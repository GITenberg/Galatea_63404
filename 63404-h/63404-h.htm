<h2>INTRODUCTION TO THE GALATEA.</h2>


<p>Simple as the bibliography of the <cite>Galatea</cite> really is, a habit of conjecture has
succeeded in complicating it. Though the earliest known edition of the book is
unanimously admitted to have appeared at Alcalá de Henares in 1585, it is often
alleged that the <em>princeps</em> was actually issued at Madrid during the previous
year. This is a mistaken idea arising, probably, out of a slip made by Gregorio
Mayáns y Siscar, the first Spaniard<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who attempted to write a formal biography
of Cervantes. In his thirteenth paragraph Mayáns<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> remarked by the way that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[Pg viii]</span>the <cite>Galatea</cite> was published in 1584; but he laid no stress upon the date, and
dismissed the matter in a single sentence. The error (if it were really an error,
and not a mere misprint) was natural and pardonable enough in one who lived
before bibliography had developed into an exact study. Unfortunately, it was
reproduced by others. It is found, for instance, in a biographical essay on
Cervantes which precedes the first edition of <cite>Don Quixote</cite> issued by the Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[Pg ix]</span>Spanish Academy;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the essayist, Vicente de los Ríos, adds the detail
that the <cite>Galatea</cite> came out at Madrid. It was unlucky that this statement
should be put forward where it is. The Academy's responsibility for the
texts issued in its name is chiefly financial: for the rest, it habitually appoints
the most competent representatives available, and it naturally gives each
delegate a free hand. But foreigners, unacquainted with the procedure, have
imagined that Ríos must be taken as expressing the deliberate and unanimous
opinion of the entire Academy. This is a complete misapprehension. On the
face of it, it is absurd to suppose that any corporation, as a whole, is irrevocably
committed to every view expressed by individual members. Even were it otherwise,
it would not affect the case. An error would be none the less an error
if a learned society sanctioned it. But, as a matter of fact, like all those
concerned in editing texts or in writing essays for the Academy, Ríos spoke
for himself alone. He was followed by Pellicer<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who, though he gives 1584 as
the date of the <em>princeps</em>, is less categorical as to the place of publication. Some
twenty-two years after Pellicer's time, Fernández de Navarrete<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> accepted his
predecessors' view as regards the date, and to this acceptance, more than
to anything else, the common mistake is due. Relying on Navarrete's
unequalled authority, Ticknor<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> repeated the mis-statement which has since
passed into general circulation. Further enquiry has destroyed the theory that
the <cite>Galatea</cite> first appeared at Madrid in 1584. However, as most English
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[Pg x]</span>writers<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> on this question have given currency to the old, erroneous notion, it
becomes necessary to set forth the circumstances of the case. But, before
entering upon details, it should be observed (1) that no copy of the supposititious
1584 edition has ever been seen by any one; (2) that there is not even an
indirect proof of its existence; and (3) that, so far as the evidence goes, no
edition of the <cite>Galatea</cite> was published at Madrid before 1736: that is to say,
until more than a century after Cervantes's death.</p>

<p>We do not know precisely when the <cite>Galatea</cite> was written. M. Dumaine,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
indeed, declares positively that the poems in the volume&mdash;he must surely mean
some of them, not all&mdash;were addressed to a lady during the author's stay in
Italy. If this were so, these verses would date (at latest) from September, 1575,
when Cervantes left Italy for the last time. Sr. D. José María Asensio y Toledo<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
holds that the <cite>Galatea</cite> was begun in Portugal soon after the writer's return from
Algiers in 1580. Of these views one may conceivably be true; one must necessarily
be false; and it is more than possible that both are wrong. As no data
are forthcoming to support either opinion, we may profitably set aside these speculations
and proceed to examine the particulars disclosed in the preliminaries of the
<cite>Galatea</cite>. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Aprobación</i> was signed by Lucas Gracián<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Dantisco at Madrid
on February 1, 1584, and, as some time must have passed between the sub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[Pg xi]</span>mission
of the manuscript to the censor and the issue of his license, it seems
certain that the text of the <cite>Galatea</cite> was finished before the end of 1583. In its
present form, the dedication, as will be seen presently, cannot have been written
till about the end of the following summer. Meanwhile, on February 22, 1584,
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Privilegio</i> was granted at Madrid in the King's name by Antonio de Erasso.
It was not till a year later&mdash;the very end of February 1585&mdash;that the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Fe de
erratas</i> was passed at Alcalá de Henares by the Licenciado Vares de Castro,
official corrector to the University of that city. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tasa</i>, which bears the
name of Miguel Ondarza Zabala, was despatched at Madrid on March 13, 1585.</p>

<p>To those who have had no occasion to study such matters as these, the space of
time which elapsed between the concession of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Privilegio</i> and the despatch of
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tasa</i> might seem considerable; and it is not surprising that this circumstance
should be the basis of erroneous deductions on their part. Apparently for no
other reason than the length of this interval, it has been concluded that, between
February 22, 1584, and March 13, 1585, there was printed at Madrid an edition
of the <cite>Galatea</cite>, every copy of which has&mdash;<em>ex hypothesi</em>&mdash;vanished. This
assumption is gratuitous.</p>

<p>It is true that the first editions of certain very popular Spanish books&mdash;such as the
<cite>Celestina</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> <cite>Amadís de Gaula</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> <cite>Lazarillo de Tormes</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> <cite>Guzmán de Alfarache</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[Pg xii]</span>and <cite>Don Quixote</cite><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;tend to become exceedingly rare and are, perhaps,
occasionally thumbed out of existence altogether. But the <cite>Galatea</cite>, like all
pastoral novels, appealed to a comparatively restricted class of readers, and was
in no danger of wide popularity. No doubt the <em>princeps</em> of the <cite>Galatea</cite> is
exceptionally rare,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;rarer than the <em>princeps</em> of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>; but rarity, taken
by itself, is no proof that a work was popular, and, in the present instance, the
rarity may be due to the fact that the <cite>Galatea</cite> was issued in a more or less
limited edition. This is what we should expect in the case of a first book
published in a provincial town by an author who had still to make his reputation;
but, in the absence of direct testimony, the question cannot be decided. What can
be proved by any one at all acquainted with Spanish bibliography is that there was
no unexampled delay in publishing the <cite>Galatea</cite>. Similar instances abound; but,
for our present purpose, it will suffice to mention two which are&mdash;or should be&mdash;familiar
to all who are specially interested in Cervantes and in his writings. As
we have just seen, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tasa</i> of the <cite>Galatea</cite> is dated thirteen months after the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Aprobación</i>. An exact parallel to this is afforded by Cervantes's own <cite>Novelas
exemplares</cite>: Fray Juan Bautista signed the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Aprobación</i> on July 9, 1612, and
Hernando de Vallejo signed the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tasa</i> on August 12, 1613.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Here the interval is
precisely thirteen months. A still more striking instance of dilatoriness is
revealed in the preliminaries to another work which has been consulted&mdash;or, at
least, quoted as though it were familiar to them&mdash;by almost all writers on Cervantes
from 1761 onwards: namely, Diego de Haedo's <cite>Topographia e Historia general
de Argel</cite>, published at Valladolid in 1612. Haedo obtained the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Aprobación</i> on
October 6, 1604, but the licence was not given till February 8, 1610. In this
instance, then, the legal formalities were spread out over five years and, at the
final stage, there was a further pause of three years; in all, a delay of eight years.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[Pg xiii]</span>There is no ground for assuming that the official procedure in these matters was
more expeditions in 1585 than it was a quarter of a century later and, consequently,
in the case of the <cite>Galatea</cite>, the interval of time between the issue of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Aprobación</i>
and the despatch of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tasa</i> cannot be regarded as calling for any
far-fetched explanation.</p>

<p>The author's Letter Dedicatory to Ascanio Colonna, Abbot of St. Sophia, is
undated, but it contains a passage which incidentally throws light on the bibliography
of the <cite>Galatea</cite>. Speaking of his military service under Ascanio Colonna's
father, Cervantes mentions his late chief&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aquel sol de la milicia que ayer nos
quitó el cielo delante de los ojos</i>&mdash;in terms which imply that Marco Antonio
Colonna's death was a comparatively recent event. Now, we know from the
official death-certificate<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that the Viceroy of Sicily, when on his way to visit
Philip II., died at Medinaceli on August 1, 1584&mdash;exactly six months after the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Aprobación</i> for the <cite>Galatea</cite> had been obtained. Allowing for the rate at which
news travelled in the sixteenth century, it seems improbable that Cervantes can
have written his dedication much before the end of August 1584. It is conceivable,
no doubt, that he wrote two different dedications&mdash;one for the alleged
Madrid edition of 1584, and another for the Alcalá edition of 1585. It is equally
conceivable that though the Alcalá edition of the <cite>Galatea</cite>, in common with every
subsequent work by Cervantes, has a dedication, the supposititious Madrid edition
was (for some reason unknown) published without one. Manifestly, one of these
alternatives must be adopted by believers in the imaginary <em>princeps</em>. But,
curiously enough, the point does not appear to have occurred to them; for, up to the
present time, no such hypothesis has been advanced. Assuming, as we may fairly
assume, that only one dedication was written, the complete manuscript of the
<cite>Galatea</cite> cannot well have reached the compositors till September or October 1584.
It is possible that some part of the text was set up before this date, but of this we
have no proof. If the 375 leaves&mdash;750 pages&mdash;of which the book consists were
struck off late in January or early in February 1585, so as to allow of the text
being revised by the official corrector at Alcalá de Henares, and thence forwarded
to Madrid by the beginning of March, it must be admitted that the achievement
did credit to the country printer, Juan de Gracián, whose name figures on the
title-page. Further, as Salvá<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> shrewdly remarks, the appearance of the Colonna
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[Pg xiv]</span>escutcheon on this same title-page affords a presumption that the Alcalá edition of
1585 is the <em>princeps</em>: for it is unreasonable to suppose that a struggling provincial
publisher of the sixteenth century would go to the expense of furnishing a
simple reprint with a complimentary woodcut.</p>

<p>Each of the foregoing circumstances, considered separately, tells against the
current idea that the <cite>Galatea</cite> was published at Madrid in 1584, and it might
have been hoped that an intelligent consideration of their cumulative effect
would ensure the right conclusion: that the story is a myth. But, so Donoso
Cortés<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> maintained, man has an almost invincible propensity to error, and the
discussion on so plain a matter as the bibliography of the <cite>Galatea</cite> lends colour to
this view. The amount of confusion introduced into the debate is extraordinary.
It is occasionally difficult to gather what a partisan of the alleged 1584 edition
holds; his pages blaze with contradictions: his theory is half-heartedly advanced,
hastily abandoned, and confidently re-stated in a bewildering fashion.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Again,
what was originally put forward as a pious opinion is transfigured into a dogma.
Just as there are some who, when writing on the bibliography of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[Pg xv]</span>insist that the 1608 edition of that book "must have been revised by the author,"<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
so there are some who, when writing on the bibliography of the <cite>Galatea</cite>, insist
with equal positiveness that there "must have been an edition of 1584."<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This
emphasis is out of place in both cases; but it is interesting and instructive to note
that these two opinions are practically inseparable from each other. The coincidence
can scarcely be accidental, and it may prove advantageous: for, obviously,
the refutation of the one thesis must tend to discredit the other. If a writer
be convicted of error in a very simple matter which can be tested in a moment,
it would clearly be imprudent to accept his unsupported statement concerning a far
more complex matter to which no direct test can be applied. And, as it happens,
we are now enabled to measure the accuracy of the assertion that the <em>princeps</em> of
the <cite>Galatea</cite> was published at Madrid in 1584.</p>

<p>Those who take it upon themselves to lay down that there "must have been"
an edition of that place and date are bound to establish the fact. They are not
entitled to defy every rule of evidence, and to call on the other side to prove a
negative. The burden of proof lies wholly with them. But, by a rare and happy
accident, it is possible to prove a negative in the present case. In view of recent
researches, the theory that the <em>princeps</em> of the <cite>Galatea</cite> was issued at Madrid in
1584 is absolutely untenable. All doubts or hesitations on this head are ended
by the opportune discovery, due to that excellent scholar and fortunate investigator,
Dr. Pérez Pastor, of the original contract between Cervantes and the
Alcalá publisher, Blas de Robles. By this contract Blas de Robles binds himself
to pay 1336 <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">reales</i> (£29. 13s. 9d. English) for the author's entire rights.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[Pg xvi]</span>legal instrument is decisive, for it would be ridiculous&mdash;not to say impertinent&mdash;to
suppose that Cervantes sold his interest twice over to two different publishers
in two different cities. There can, therefore, be no further controversy as to
when and where the <cite>Galatea</cite> appeared. It is now placed beyond dispute that
Cervantes had not found a publisher before June 1584, and that the book was
issued at Alcalá de Henares in 1585&mdash;probably not before the month of April.
The first intention was to entitle the volume <cite>Los seys libros de Galatea</cite> but
(perhaps with a view to emphasizing the promise of a sequel) it was actually
published as the <cite>Primera Parte de la Galatea, dividida en seys libros</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> On
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[Pg xvii]</span>June 14, 1584, Cervantes received 1116 <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">reales</i> in advance, and, by a deed of the
same date, Blas de Robles undertook to pay the balance of 250 <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">reales</i> at the end
of September:<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the very period when, as already conjectured, the printing was
begun.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[Pg xviii]</span></p>

<p>Cervantes was in his thirty-third year when he was ransomed at Algiers on
September 19, 1580, and, when he reached Portugal in 1581, he may have
intended to enlist once more. It has, in fact, been generally thought that he
shared in at least one of the expeditions against the Azores under the famous
Marqués de Santa Cruz in 1581-83. This belief is based on the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Información</i>
presented by Cervantes at Madrid on June 6, 1590;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> but in this petition to the
King the claims of Rodrigo de Cervantes and Miguel de Cervantes are set forth
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[Pg xix]</span>
in so confusing a fashion that it is difficult to distinguish the services of the
elder brother from those of the junior. It is certain that Rodrigo served at the
Azores in 1583, and we learn from Mosquera de Figueroa that he was promoted
from the ranks for his distinguished gallantry in the action before Porto das Moas.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
But it is by no means clear that Miguel de Cervantes took any part in either
campaign. Such evidence as we have tells rather against the current supposition.
It is ascertained that Cervantes was at Tomar on May 21, 1581, and that he was
at Cartagena towards the end of June 1581, while we have documentary evidence
to prove that he pawned five pieces of yellow and red taffeta to Napoléon Lomelin
at Madrid in the autumn of 1583.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> If these dates are correct (as they seem to
be), it is scarcely possible that Cervantes can have sailed with Santa Cruz
for the Azores.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The likelihood is that he had to be content with some
civil employment and, if so, it was natural enough that he should turn to
literature with a view to increasing his small income. A modest, clear-sighted
man, he probably did not imagine that he was about to write masterpieces, or
to make a fortune by his pen. He perhaps hoped to keep the wolf from the
door, or, at the most, to find a rich patron, as his friend Gálvez de Montalvo had
done.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> If these were his ideas, and if, as seems likely, he thought of marrying at
about this time, it is not surprising that he should write what he believed would
sell. So far as we can judge, he would much rather have wielded a sword than a
goose-quill, and he was far too great a humorist to vapour about "art" or an
"irresistible vocation." His juvenile verses had found favour with Juan López de
Hoyos, and perhaps Rufino de Chamberí had appreciated the two sonnets written
in Algiers; but the spirited tercets to Mateo Vázquez had failed of their effect, and
Cervantes was shrewd enough to know that versifying was not lucrative. Eighty
years before it was uttered, he realized the truth of the divine Gombauld's dying exclamation:
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On paie si mal des vers immortels!</i> Fortunately, he had many strings
to his bow. Like Lope de Vega, he was prepared to attempt anything and everything:
prose or verse, the drama, picaresque tales, novels of adventure, and the
rest. But, to begin with, he divided his efforts between the theatre and fiction.</p>

<p>In the latter province the path of a beginner was clearly marked out. Too
obscure, as yet, to venture upon a line of his own, and anxious, if possible, to
conciliate the general body of readers, Cervantes was practically compelled to
choose between the chivalresque romance and the pastoral. Not knowing that he
was born to kill the former kind, he decided in favour of the latter&mdash;and for
obvious reasons. The Knight-errantries of Amadís and his comrades had been
in vogue from the fourteenth&mdash;perhaps even from the thirteenth<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;century
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[Pg xx]</span>onwards. <cite>Amadís de Gaula</cite> was printed at least as early as 1508,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and had
begotten a numerous tribe; but, when Cervantes was feeling his way in the ninth
decade of the sixteenth century, popular enthusiasm for these tales of chivalry
was cooling. The pastoral novel was the latest literary fashion. It would,
possibly, be too much to say that the Spanish pastoral novel was a mere offshoot of
the chivalresque romances; yet it is undeniable that the pastoral element is found
in chivalresque stories of comparatively early date. For example, in the
ninth book of <cite>Amadís</cite>, entitled <cite>Amadís de Grecia</cite> (1530) the shepherd Darinel
and the shepherdess Sylvia are among the characters; in the first two parts of <cite>Don
Florisel de Niquea</cite> (1532) the hero masquerades as a shepherd and pays his
court to the shepherdess Sylvia; in the fourth part of <cite>Don Florisel de Niquea</cite>
(1551) the eclogues of Archileo and Laris are early instances of what was destined
to become a tedious convention.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> These, however, are simple foreshadowings of
an independent school of fiction which was in full vigour while Cervantes was
still a boy.</p>

<p>The Spanish chivalresque novel is thought by many sound judges to derive
directly from Portugal,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which may, in its turn, have received the material of its
knightly tales&mdash;and perhaps something more than the raw material&mdash;from Celtic
France.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The conclusion is disputed,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> but whatever opinion may prevail as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[Pg xxi]</span>regards the source of the books of chivalry, it seems fairly certain that the
pastoral novel was introduced into Spain by a Portuguese writer whose inspiration
came to him from Italy. In a general sense, Virgil is the father of the
pastoral in all Latin lands: the more immediate source of the Italian pastoral is
believed to be Boccaccio's <cite>Ameto</cite>, the model of Tasso and Guarini as also of Bembo
and Sannasaro. Jacopo Sannazaro,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> a Neapolitan courtier of Spanish descent, is
the connecting link between the literatures of Italy and the Peninsula during the
first part of the sixteenth century. His vogue in the latter was enhanced through
the instrumentality of the renowned poet Garcilaso de la Vega,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> the "starry
paladin" of Spain. No small part of Garcilaso's work is a poetic recasting of
Sannazaro's themes,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and we can scarcely doubt that Sannazaro's <cite>Arcadia</cite>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[Pg xxii]</span>suggested the first genuine Spanish pastoral to the Portuguese, Jorge de
Montemôr, so called from his birthplace. The point has been contested, for
Montemôr's <cite>Siete libros de la Diana</cite> are often said to have been published in
1542,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and the first Spanish translation of Sannazaro's <cite>Arcadia</cite> (by Diego López
de Ayala) does not appear to have been issued till 1547.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It may, however, be
taken as established that Montemôr's <cite>Diana</cite> was not really printed much
earlier than 1558-9,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> when it at once became the fashion.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The argument
sets forth that in the city of León, by the banks of the Ezla, dwelt the beautiful
shepherdess Diana, beloved of the shepherds Sireno and Silvano; the shepherdess
favours Sireno, who is suddenly called away to foreign countries, whence he
returns a year later to find a change of times and hearts, Diana being wedded to
the shepherd Delio: "and here beginneth the first book, and in the remainder you
shall find very diverse histories of events which in sooth befell, howbeit travestied
under a pastoral style." Montemôr's diverse histories, which owe something to
Bernardim Ribeiro's <cite>Saudades</cite> or <cite>Hystoria de Menina e moça</cite><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> (a novel that
begins as a chivalresque romance and ends as a pastoral tale), took Western
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii"></a>[Pg xxiii]</span>Europe by storm. They may have been in Spenser's mind when he wrote <cite>The
Shepherd's Calendar</cite>: they were unquestionably utilized by Sir Philip Sidney
in <cite>The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia</cite>, and it has been alleged with more
or less plausibility that&mdash;possibly through Bartholomew Yong's version of
Montemôr, which was finished in 1583, though not published till fifteen years
later&mdash;the episode of Felismena has been transferred from the <cite>Diana</cite> to
the <cite>Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite>.</p>

<p>The <cite>Diana</cite> ends with the promise of a Second Part in which the shepherd Danteo
and the shepherdess Duarda shall figure, but this Second Part was not forthcoming
as Montemôr was killed in Piedmont on February 26, 1561.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> His design was
very badly executed in 1564 by his friend Alonso Pérez, a Salamancan physician,
who had the assurance to boast that there was scarcely a scrap of original prose
or verse in his volume, the whole (as he vaunts) being stolen and imitated from
Latins and Italians. "Nor," adds this astonishing doctor, "do I deem that I am
in any sort to blame therefor, since they did as much by the Greeks."<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Another,
and a far better, continuation of Montemôr's <cite>Diana</cite> was issued at Valencia in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv"></a>[Pg xxiv]</span>this same year of 1664 by Gaspar Gil Polo&mdash;a sequel which, after proving almost
as successful as Montemôr's original, was destined to be plagiarized in the most
shameless fashion by Hierónimo de Texeda.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>That Cervantes was well acquainted with these early Spanish pastorals is proved
by the discussion on the little books&mdash;contrasting with the hundred and more
stately folios of the chivalresque romances&mdash;in Don Quixote's library. The niece
of the Ingenious Gentleman thought that these slimmer volumes should "be
burned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after being cured
of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a fancy to turn shepherd
and range the woods and fields singing and piping." The Priest agrees in principle,
but in practice he is more mercifully disposed:&mdash;"To begin, then, with the <cite>Diana</cite>
of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be burned, but that it should be
cleared of all that about the sage Felicia and the magic water,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and of almost all
the longer pieces of verse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the honour of
being the first of books of the kind." And when questioned concerning the above-named
sequels, the judicious Priest declares:&mdash;"As for that of the Salamancan, let it
go to swell the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo's be preserved
as if it came from Apollo himself." With this jest on Gil Polo's name,
the Priest passes over the next in order of the pastoral novels, Jerónimo de
Arbolanche's <cite>Las Habidas</cite> (1566)<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>&mdash;a very rare work which, though not on
Don Quixote's shelves, was more or less vaguely known to Cervantes<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>&mdash;to pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[Pg xxv]</span>nounce
judgment on <cite>Los diez Libros de Fortuna d'Amor</cite>, an amazingly foolish
book published in 1573 by a Sardinian soldier named Antonio de lo Frasso. Cervantes
was just the man to praise (if possible) the work of an old comrade-in-arms,
and, in fact, he contrived (through the Priest) to express his opinion of lo
Frasso's book in terms which proved misleading:&mdash;"By the orders I have received,
since Apollo has been Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been
poets, so droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its way it
is the best and the most singular of all of this species that have as yet appeared,
and he who has not read it may be sure he has never read what is delightful. Give
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi"></a>[Pg xxvi]</span>it here, gossip, for I make more account of having found it than if they had given
me a cassock of Florence stuff." It might seem difficult to interpret this as praise,
and impossible to misunderstand the Priest's delight at meeting with what had
already become a bibliographical rarity; but, some hundred and thirty years later,
the last words of the passage were taken seriously and led to a reprint of lo
Frasso's book by Pedro de Pineda, one of the correctors of Tonson's <cite>Don Quixote</cite>,
who had manifestly overlooked the ridicule of the Sardinian in the <cite>Viaje del
Parnaso</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>These pastorals, together with the chivalresque romances, had probably been
the entertainment of Cervantes's youth. It was probably another and much
later essay of the same kind which induced him to try his luck in the pastoral
vein: the <cite>Pastor de Fílida</cite>, published at Madrid in 1582 by his friend Luis
Gálvez de Montalvo, who is said (on doubtful authority, as we shall see presently)
to have introduced Cervantes in his text as the shepherd Tirsi&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">de
clarísimo ingenio</i>. Whether this be so, or not, Cervantes, in his usual kindly,
indulgent way, places his friend's work on Don Quixote's shelves, and treats it
with gracious deference:&mdash;"No Pastor that, but a highly polished courtier;
let it be preserved as a precious jewel." The book has but trifling interest
for us nowadays; yet we may be sure that Cervantes's admiration was whole-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii"></a>[Pg xxvii]</span>hearted,
and the fact that the volume passed through several editions<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> vindicates
him from any suspicion of excessive partiality. It was his fine habit to praise
generously. Neither his temperament nor his training was critical, and he
attached even more than its due importance to the verdict of the public. He
frankly rejoiced in Gálvez de Montalvo's success, and it is not unreasonable
to conjecture that this success helped to hasten the appearance of the <cite>Galatea</cite>.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that Cervantes, whose transcriptions from life are
eminently distinguished for truth and force, should have been induced to
experiment in the province of artificial, languid pastoralism. But if, as Taine
would have it, climate makes the race, the race makes the individual, and at
this period the races of Western Europe had gone (so to say) pastorally mad.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
The pastoral novel is not to our modern taste; but, as there is no more stability
in literature than in politics, its day may come again.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> In Cervantes's time there
was no escaping from the prose idyll. Prodigious tales from the Indies had stimulated
the popular appetite for wonders, and the demand was supplied to satiety in
the later chivalresque romances. Feliciano de Silva and his fellows could think of
nothing better than the systematic exaggeration of the most marvellous episodes
in <cite>Amadís de Gaula</cite>. The adventures became more perilous, the knights more
fantastically brave, the ladies (if possible) lovelier, the wizards craftier, the
giants huger, the monsters more terrific, and so forth. In this vein nothing
more was to be done: the formula was exhausted. The rival and more cultured
school, founded by Sannazaro, endeavoured to lead men's minds from these
noisy banalities to the placid contemplation of nature, or rather of idealized
antiquity, by substituting for the din of arms, the stir of cities, and the
furrowing of strange oceans by the prows of vulgar traders, the still, primeval</p>

<p>"Summers of the snakeless meadow, unlaborious earth, and oarless sea."</p>

<p>Unluckily no departure from Sannazaro's original pattern was thought legitimate.
Sir Philip Sidney rejects every attempt at innovation with the crushing
remark that "neyther Theocritus in Greek, Virgill in Latine, nor Sanazar in
Italian did affect it."<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Hence the unbroken monotony of the pastoral convention.
Nothing is easier than to mock at this new Arcadia where beauteous shepherdesses
vanish discreetly behind glades and brakes, where golden-mouthed shepherds exchange
confidences of unrequited passion, arguing the high metaphysical doctrine
of Platonic love, or chanting most melancholy madrigals at intervals which the
seasoned reader can calculate to a nicety beforehand. There never was, and never
could be, such an atmosphere of deliberate dilettantism in such a world as ours.
Taken as a whole these late Renascence pastorals weary us, as Sidney's <cite>Arcadia</cite>
wearied Hazlitt, with their everlasting "alliteration, antithesis and metaphysical
conceit," their "continual, uncalled-for interruptions, analysing, dissecting, disjointing,
murdering everything, and reading a pragmatical, self-sufficient lecture
over the dead body of nature." Briefly, while these pastoral writers of the
sixteenth century persuaded themselves and their readers that they were
returning to communion with hills and forests, to us it seems as though they
offered little beyond unassimilated reminiscences of conventional classicism.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii"></a></span></p>
<p>It would be idle to deny that the <cite>Galatea</cite> has many defects of the school to
which it belongs, but it must always have a singular interest as being the first
serious literary experiment made by a writer of consummate genius. Cervantes
had the model, the sacred model, perpetually before his eyes, and he copied it (if
not with conviction) with a grim determination which speaks for itself. He, too,&mdash;the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ingenio lego</i>&mdash;must be interpolating his learning, and referring to Virgil, Ovid,
Propertius and the rest of them, with an air of intimate familiarity. Twenty
years afterwards, when he had outgrown these little affectations, and was
penning the amusing passage in which he banters Lope's childish pedantry,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the
brilliant humorist must surely have smiled as he remembered his own performances
in the same kind. He does honour to the grand tradition of prolixity
by putting wiredrawn conceits into the mouths of shepherds who are much more
like love-sick Abelards than like Comatas or Lacon, and, when his own stock of
scholastic subtleties is ended, he has no scruple in allotting to Lenio and Tirsi<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> a
short summary of the arguments which had been used long before by Filone and
Sofía in his favourite book, León Hebreo's <cite>Dialoghi di Amore</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Had he taken far
more material than he actually took, he would have been well within his rights,
according to the prevailing ideas of literary morality. Whatever illiterate
admirers may say, it is certain that Cervantes followed the fashion in
borrowing freely from his predecessors. No careful reader of the <cite>Galatea</cite> can
doubt that its author either had Sannazaro's <cite>Arcadia</cite> on his table, or that he
knew it almost by heart.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> His appreciation for the <cite>Arcadia</cite> was unbounded,
and in the <cite>Viaje del Parnaso</cite><a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the sight of Posilipo causes him to link
together the names of Virgil and Sannazaro:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p01">In the <cite>Galatea</cite>, enthusiasm takes the form of conscientious imitation. It cannot
be mere coincidence that Ergasto's song&mdash; <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Alma beata et bella</i>&mdash;is echoed by
Elicio as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">O alma venturosa</i>; that such a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ritornello</i> as <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ricominciate, o Muse,

fin, o Muse, al vostro pianto</i> is rendered as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pastores, cesad ya del triste
canto</i>. The sixth book of the <cite>Galatea</cite> is an undisguised adaptation of Sannazaro's
work. In view of these resemblances, and many others indicated by
Professor Scherillo,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> the large indebtedness of Cervantes to Sannazaro cannot be
denied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx"></a>[Pg xxx]</span></p>

<p>Nor are León Hebreo and Sannazaro Cervantes's sole creditors. The <cite>Canto de
Calíope</cite>, which commemorates the merits of a hundred poets and poetasters, was
probably suggested by the <cite>Canto de Turia</cite> in the third book of Gil Polo's
<cite>Diana enamorada</cite>, or by the list of rhymers in Boscán's <cite>Octava Rima</cite>, or even
by a similar catalogue interpolated in the thirty-eighth canto of Luis Zapata's unreadable
epic, <cite>Carlos famoso</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It may be pleaded for Cervantes that he
admired Boscán, Gil Polo, and Zapata, and that his imitation of them is natural
enough. <cite>Sea muy enhorabuena.</cite> The same explanation cannot apply to the
uncanny resemblance, which Professor Rennert<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> has pointed out, between the
address to Nisida in the third book of the <cite>Galatea</cite> and the letter to Cardenia in the
second book of Alonso Pérez' worthless sequel to Montemôr's <cite>Diana</cite>. Had Cervantes
remembered this small loan when writing the sixth chapter of <cite>Don
Quixote</cite>, gratitude would probably have led him to pass a more lenient sentence
on the impudent Salamancan doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi"></a>[Pg xxxi]</span></p>

<p>It was in strict accordance with the pastoral tradition that the author should
introduce himself and his friends into his story. In Virgil's Fifth Eclogue,
Daphnis was said to stand for Julius Cæsar, Mopsus for Æmilius Macer of
Verona, Menalcas for the poet himself. Sannazaro had, it was believed, revived
the fashion in Italy.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Ribeiro presented himself to the public as Bimnardel,
Montemôr asked for sympathy under the name of Sireno, and Sir Philip
Sidney masqueraded as Pyrocles. In the <cite>Pastor de Fílida</cite>, it is understood
that Mendino is Don Enrique de Mendoza y Aragón, that Pradileo is the Conde de
Prades (Luis Ramón y Folch), that Silvano is the poet Gregorio Silvestre, that
Tirsi is Francisco de Figueroa (or, as some rashly say,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Cervantes), and that
Montalvo himself appears as Siralvo. The new recruit observed the precedents
and, if we are to accept the authority of Navarrete,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> the Tirsi, Damon, Meliso,
Siralvo, Lauso, Larsileo, and Artidoro of the <cite>Galatea</cite> are pseudonyms for Francisco
de Figueroa, Pedro Láinez, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Luis Gálvez de
Montalvo, Luis Barahona de Soto, Alonso de Ercilla, and Andrés Rey de Artieda
respectively.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Lastly, commentators and biographers are mostly agreed that the
characters of Elicio and Galatea stand for Cervantes and for Doña Catalina de
Palacios Salazar y Vozmediano<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> whom he married some ten months after the
official <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Aprobación</i> to his novel was signed. We know on Cervantes's own
statement that many of his shepherds were shepherds in appearance only,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and
Lope de Vega confirms the tradition;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> but we shall do well to remember that, in
attempting to identify the characters of a romance with personages in real life,
conjecture plays a considerable part.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Some of the above identifications might
easily be disputed, and, at the best, we can scarcely doubt that most of the
likenesses given by Cervantes in the <cite>Galatea</cite> are composite portraits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxii"></a>[Pg xxxii]</span></p>

<p>In any case, it is difficult to take a deep interest in Cervantes's seventy-one<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> shepherds
and shepherdesses. Their sensibility is too exquisite for this world. Among
the swains, Lisandro, Silenio, Mireno, Grisaldo, Erastro, Damon, Telesio, Lauso, and
Lenio weep most copiously. Among the nymphs, Galatea, Lidia, Rosaura, Teolinda,
Maurisa, Nisida and Blanca choke with tears. Teolinda, Leonarda and
Rosaura swoon; Silerio, Timbrio, Darinto, Elicio and Lenio drop down in a dead
faint. In mind and body these shepherds and shepherdesses are exceptionally
endowed. They can remain awake for days. They can recite, without slurring a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii"></a>[Pg xxxiii]</span>
comma, a hundred or two hundred lines of a poem heard once, years ago; and the
casuistry of their amorous dialectics would do credit to Sánchez or Escobar. All
this is common form. A generation later, Honoré d'Urfé replied to the few who
might accuse Astrée of talking above her station:&mdash;"Reponds-leur, ma Bergere,
que pour peu qu'ils ayent connoissance de toy, ils sçauront que tu n'es pas,
ny celles aussi qui te suiuent, de ces Bergeres necessiteuses qui pour gagner leur vie
conduisent les troupeaux aux pasturages: mais que vous n'auez toutes pris cette
condition que pour viure plus doucement &amp; sans contrainte. Que si vos conceptions
&amp; vos paroles estoient veritablement telles que celles des Bergers ordinaires,
ils auroient aussi peu de plaisir de vous escouter que vous auriez beaucoup de
honte à les redire."<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The plea was held to be good. The pastoral convention of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries thrust out all realism as an unclean
thing. The pity is that Cervantes, in his effort to conform to the rule, was
compelled to stifle what was best and rarest in his genius. Yet, amid these
philosophizings and artificialities, a few gleams of his peculiar, parenthetical
humour flash from him unawares: as when the refined Teolinda seeks to console
Lidia&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">limpiándole los ojos con la manga de mi camisa</i>:<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> or in the description
of Crisalvo's fury&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">que le sacaba de juicio, aunque él tenía tan poco, que
poco era menester para acabárselo</i>: or in Arsindo's thoughtful remark that the
shepherds might possibly be missed by the flocks from which they had been absent
for the last ten days. Again, there is a foreshadowing of a famous passage in <cite>Don
Quixote</cite> when the writer compares the shepherd's life with the courtier's. Once
more, the story of Timbrio's adventures&mdash;which are anything but idyllic&mdash;is
given with uncommon spirit. There are ingenuity and fancy in many of the
poems, and there is interest as well as grace in the little autobiographical touches&mdash;the
mention of Arnaute Mamí, the local patriotism that surges up in allusions to
the river Henares on which stands the author's native town&mdash;<cite>el gran Compluto</cite>,
as he says in his eloquent way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv"></a>[Pg xxxiv]</span></p>
<p>Cervantes is admittedly a wonderful creator; but the pastoral of his
time&mdash;a pastiche or mosaic of conventional figures&mdash;gave him no opportunity
of displaying his powers as an inventor. He is also a very great prose-writer,
ranging with an easy mastery from the loftiest rhetoric to the quick
thrust-and-parry of humoristic colloquy. Still, as has often been remarked, his
attention is apt to wander, and vigilant grammarians have detected (and
chronicled) slips in his most brilliant chapters. In the matter of correctness,
the <cite>Galatea</cite> compares favourably with <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, and its style has been
warmly eulogized by the majority of critics. And, on the whole, the praise is
deserved. The <cite>Galatea</cite> is (one fancies) the result of much deliberation&mdash;the preliminary
essay of a writer no longer young indeed, but abounding in hope, in
courage, and in knowledge of the best literary models which his country
had produced. The First Part of <cite>Don Quixote</cite> was dashed off at
odds and ends of time by a man acquainted with rebuffs, poverty,
disastrous failure of every kind. Purists may point to five grammatical flaws in
<cite>Don Quixote</cite> for one in the <cite>Galatea</cite>, and naturally the latter gains by this
comparison. But, whatever the technical weaknesses of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, that book
has the supreme merit of allowing Cervantes to be himself. In the <cite>Galatea</cite> he
is, so far as his means allow, Virgil, Longus, Boccaccio, Petrarch, León Hebreo,
Sannazaro, Montemôr&mdash;even the unhappy Pérez&mdash;every one, in fact, but himself.
Hence, in the very nature of things, the smoothly filed periods of this first romance
cease to be characteristic of the writer, and have even led some to charge him
with being a corrupter of the language, a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">culto</i> before <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">culteranismo</i> was invented.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv"></a>[Pg xxxv]</span></p>
<p>The charm of Cervantes's style, at its best, lies in its spontaneity, strength,
variety, swiftness, and noble simplicity: it is the unrestrained expression of his most
original and seductive personality. In the <cite>Galatea</cite>, on the other hand, Cervantes
is too often an echo, a timid copyist, reproducing the accepted <em>clichés</em> with
an exasperating scrupulousness. Galatea is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">discreta</i>, Silvia is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">discreta</i>, Teolinda
is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">discreta</i>: Lisandro is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">discreto</i>, Artidoro is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">discreto</i>, Damon is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">discreto</i>. The
noun and its regulation epithet are never sundered from each other. And <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verde</i>&mdash;the
eternal adjective <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verde</i>&mdash;haunts the distracted reader like an obsession:
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verdes árboles</i>, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verde suelo</i>, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verde yerba</i>, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verde prado</i>, the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verde carga</i>, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verde llano</i>, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verde parra</i>, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verde laurel</i>, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verdes
ramos</i>,&mdash;and even <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verdes ojos</i>.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> A hillock is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">espeso</i>: a wood is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">espeso</i>. One
may choose between <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">verdadero y honesto amor</i> and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">perfeto y verdadero amor</i>.
Beauty is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">extremada</i>: grace or wit is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">extremada</i>: a good voice is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">extremada</i>.
And <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">infinito</i> sparkles on almost every second page. It is all, of course,
extremely correct and in accord with a hundred thousand precedents. But,
since the charm palls after incessant repetition, it would not be surprising if some
should think that such undeviating fidelity to a model is not an unmixed good,
that tame academic virtues may be bought too dear, and that a single chapter
of that sadly incorrect book, <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, is worth a whole wilderness of impeccable
pastorals.</p>

<p>Still we cannot feel so sure as we should wish to be that Cervantes was of this
mind. He longed to be an Arcadian, though he had no true vocation for the business.
And yet the sagacious criticism of Berganza in the <cite>Coloquio de los perros</cite><a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
shows that he saw the absurdity of shepherds and shepherdesses passing "their
whole lives in singing and playing on the pipes, bagpipes, rebecks, and hautboys,
and other outlandish instruments." The intelligent dog perceived that all such
tales as the <cite>Diana</cite> "are dreams well written to amuse the idle, and not truth at
all, for, had they been so, there would have been some trace among my shepherds
of that most happy life and of those pleasant meadows, spacious woods, sacred
mountains, lovely gardens, clear streams and crystal fountains, and of those
lovers' wooings as virtuous as they were eloquent, and of that swoon of the
shepherd's in this spot, of the shepherdess's in that, of the bagpipe of one
shepherd sounding here, and the flageolet of the other sounding there." Cervantes
knew well enough that shepherds in real life were not called Lauso or
Jacinto, but Domingo or Pablo; and that they spent most of their leisure, not in
chanting elegies, but in catching fleas and mending their clogs. He tells us
so. And that he realised the faults of his own performance is evident from the
verdict pronounced on "the <cite>Galatea</cite> of Miguel de Cervantes" by the Priest in
<cite>Don Quixote</cite>:&mdash;"That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of
mine, and to my knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in
verses. His book has some good invention in it, it presents us with something
but brings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it
promises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure
of indulgence that is now denied it; and in the meantime do you, Señor Gossip,
keep it shut up in your own quarters."<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi"></a>[Pg xxxvi]</span></p>

<p>This reference, as Mr. Ormsby noted, "is Cervantes all over in its tone of
playful stoicism with a certain quiet self-assertion." Cervantes had, indeed, a
special tenderness for the <cite>Galatea</cite> as being his eldest-born&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">estas primicias de
mi corto ingenio</i>&mdash;and this is shown by his constant desire to finish it, his
persistent renewal of the promise with which the First Part closes. The history
of these promises is instructive. In 1585 Cervantes<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> publicly pledged himself to
bring out a continuation, if the First Part of the <cite>Galatea</cite> were a success: it was
to follow shortly (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">con brevedad</i>). The work does not seem to have made
a great hit; but Cervantes, the only man entitled to an opinion on this
particular matter, was satisfied with its reception and, as the Priest's
speech shows, in 1605 he held by his intention of publishing the promised
sequel. But he dallied and tarried. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Con brevedad</i> is, as posterity knows,
an expression which Cervantes interprets very liberally. Twenty-eight
years after the publication of the <cite>Galatea</cite>, he used the phrase once more
in the preface to the <cite>Novelas exemplares</cite>: the sequel to <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, he
promises, shall be forthcoming shortly (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">con brevedad</i>). This announcement
caught Avellaneda's eye, and drove him into a grotesque frenzy of disappointment.
It seems evident that he took the words&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">con brevedad</i>&mdash;in their literal
sense, imagining that Cervantes had nearly finished the Second Part of <cite>Don
Quixote</cite> in 1613, and that its appearance was a question of a few months more or
less. Accordingly, meanly determining to be first in the field, he hurried on
with his spurious sequel, penned his abusive preface, and rushed into print. It
is practically certain that this policy of sharp practice produced precisely the
result which he least desired. Perhaps he hoped that Cervantes, discouraged at
being thus forestalled, would abandon his own Second Part in disgust. There
was never a more complete miscalculation. Stung to the quick by Avellaneda's
insolence, Cervantes, in his turn, made what haste he could with the genuine continuation.
Had Avellaneda but known how to wait, the chances are that Cervantes
would have devoted his best energies to the composition of <cite>Las Semanas
del Jardín</cite> (promised in the dedication of the <cite>Novelas exemplares</cite>), or of <cite>El
Engaño á los ojos</cite> (promised in the preface to his volume of plays), or of <cite>El
famoso Bernardo</cite> (promised in the dedication of <cite>Persiles y Sigismunda</cite>).
Frittering away his diminishing strength on these various works, and enlarging
the design of <cite>Don Quixote</cite> from time to time&mdash;perhaps introducing
the Knight, the Squire, the Bachelor and the Priest as shepherds&mdash;Cervantes
might only too easily have left his masterpiece unfinished, were it not for the
unintentional stimulus given by Avellaneda's insults.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvii"></a>[Pg xxxvii]</span></p>

<p>How far is this view of the probabilities confirmed, or refuted, by what occurred
in the case of the <cite>Galatea</cite>? The Second Part of that novel, like the Second
Part of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, had been promised <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">con brevedad</i>. Ten years passed, and
still the sequel to the pastoral did not appear. Ticknor<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> records the tradition
that Cervantes "wrote the <cite>Galatea</cite> to win the favour of his lady," Doña Catalina
de Palacios Salazar y Vozmediano, and cynically adds that the new Pygmalion's
"success may have been the reason why he was less interested to finish it." The
explanation suggested is not particularly creditable to Cervantes, nor is it
credible in itself. Cervantes's intention, so often expressed, was excellent, and
it is simple justice to remember that, for the best part of the dozen years which
immediately followed the publication of the <cite>Galatea</cite>, he was earning his bread as
a tax-collector or tithe-proctor. This left him little time for literature. Twenty
years went by, and still the promised <cite>Galatea</cite> was not issued. One can
well understand it. Cervantes had been discharged from the public service:
he was close on sixty and seemed to have shot his bolt: his repute and
fortune were at the lowest point. His own belief in the <cite>Galatea</cite> might be
unbounded; but it was not very likely that he would succeed in persuading
my businesslike bookseller to issue the Second Part of a pastoral novel
which had (more or less) failed nearly a quarter of a century earlier. He struck
out a line for himself and, in a happy hour for the world, he found a publisher
for <cite>Don Quixote</cite>. It was the daring venture of a broken man with nothing
to lose, and its immense success completely changed his position. Henceforward
he was an author of established reputation, and publishers were ready enough
to take his prose and pay for it. As the reference in <cite>Don Quixote</cite> shows,
Cervantes had never, in his most hopeless moment, given up his idea of
publishing his sequel to the <cite>Galatea</cite>. His original promise in 1585 was
explicit, if conditional: and manifestly in 1605 he held that the condition had
been fulfilled. In the latter year he was much less explicit as to his
intention of publishing a continuation of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, and, in the concluding
quotation adapted from <cite>Orlando Furioso</cite>, he almost invited some other writer to
finish the book. Probably no contemporary reader would have been surprised if
the sequel to the <cite>Galatea</cite> had appeared before the sequel to <cite>Don Quixote</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Still it must be acknowledged that the instant triumph of <cite>Don Quixote</cite> altered
the situation radically. In these circumstances, which he could not
possibly have foreseen when he vaguely suggested that another hand might write
the further adventures of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, Cervantes was perfectly
justified in deciding to finish the later work before printing the earlier one. It
would have been the most natural thing in the world for an ordinary man to make
the most of his popularity and to bring out both sequels in rapid succession. But
Cervantes was not an ordinary man, and few points in his history are more
inexplicable than the fact that, after the amazing success of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, he published
practically nothing for the next eight years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxviii"></a>[Pg xxxviii]</span></p>

<p>At last in 1613, the <cite>Novelas exemplares</cite> were issued. The author was
silent as to the continuation of the <cite>Galatea</cite>, but he promised that the
Second Part of <cite>Don Quixote</cite> should be forthcoming&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">con brevedad</i>. We
know what followed. The <cite>Viaje del Parnaso</cite> was published in the winter
of 1614; and, though it contains a short Letter Dedicatory and Preface,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
which might easily have been made the vehicle of a public announcement
in Cervantes's customary manner, there is no allusion to the new <cite>Don
Quixote</cite> or to the new <cite>Galatea</cite>. Next year, however, in the dedication<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
of his <cite>Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses nuevos</cite>, Cervantes informed
the Conde de Lemos,&mdash;with whom the book was a special favourite<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>&mdash;that
he was pushing on with the <cite>Galatea</cite>. He makes the same statement in the
Prologue to the Second Part of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and the assurance is repeated by
him on his deathbed in the noble Letter Prefatory to <cite>Persiles y Sigismunda</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
This latter is a solemn occasion, and Cervantes writes in a tone of impressive
gravity which indicates that he weighed the full meaning of what he knew would
be his last message. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ayer me dieron la Extremaunción, y hoy escribo esta:
el tiempo es breve, las ansias crecen, las esperanzas menguan.</i> And, in the
Prologue, written somewhat earlier, the old man eloquent bids this merry life
farewell, declares that his quips and jests are over, and appoints a final rendezvous
with his comrades in the next world. At this supreme moment his indomitable
spirit returns to his first love, and once more he promises&mdash;for the fifth time&mdash;the
continuation of the <cite>Galatea</cite>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxix"></a>[Pg xxxix]</span></p>
</div>

<p>In view of the dying man's words it is exceptionally difficult to believe that
not a line of this sequel was actually written. It is equally difficult to
believe that, if the <cite>Galatea</cite> existed in a fragmentary state, the widow, the
daughter, the son-in-law, the patron, the publisher, the personal friends, the
countless admirers of the most illustrious and most popular novelist in all the
Spains, should have failed to print it. We cannot even venture to guess
what the facts of the case really were. From Cervantes's repeated declarations
it would seem probable that he left a considerable amount of literary manuscript
almost ready for the Licenser. With the exception of <cite>Persiles y Sigismunda</cite>,
every shred of every work that he mentions as being in preparation has
vanished. It would be strange if this befell an author of secondary rank: it is
incomprehensible when we consider Cervantes's unique position, recognized in
and out of Spain. All we know is this: that, on Cervantes's lips, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">con
brevedad</i> might mean&mdash;in fact, did mean&mdash;more than thirty years, and that
the sequel to the <cite>Galatea</cite>, though promised on five separate occasions, never
appeared. Providence would seem to have decreed against the completion of
many Spanish pastorals. Montemôr's <cite>Diana</cite>, the sequels to it by Pérez and
Gil Polo, all remained unfinished: the <cite>Galatea</cite> is unfinished, too. It
is possible, but unlikely, that the world has been defrauded of a masterpiece.
Yet, unsuited as was the pastoral <em>genre</em> to the exercise of Cervantes's
individual genius, we should eagerly desire to study his treatment of the
old theme in the maturity of his genius and with the consciousness that his
splendid reputation was at stake. He might perhaps have given us an anticipation
in prose of Lope de Vega's play, <cite>La Arcadia</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> a brilliant, poetic parody
after Cervantes's own heart. Fate has ruled against us, and</p>

<p>The pastorals lived on for many years in Spain<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and out of it; but <cite>Don
Quixote</cite>, the <cite>Novelas exemplares</cite>, <cite>Guzmán de Alfarache</cite>, and the growing
crowd of picaresque realistic tales had so completely supplanted them in popular
favour that Cervantes himself could scarcely have worked the miracle of restoring
their former vogue among his countrymen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xli"></a>[Pg xli]</span></p>
<p>Sr. D. Ramón León Máinez,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> whose honourable enthusiasm for all that relates
to Cervantes forbids his admitting that there are spots on his sun, considers the
<cite>Galatea</cite> to be the best of pastorals, and other whole-hearted admirers (such as
August and Friedrich von Schlegel)<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> have said as much. This, however, is not the
general verdict of those who have read the <cite>Galatea</cite> from beginning to end, and
really such readers are not many. Prescott<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> cautiously observes that it is "a
beautiful specimen of an insipid class." Hazlitt, who may be taken as the honest
representative of a numerous constituency, confesses that he does not know the book,
and offers an ingenious apology for his remissness. Cervantes, he declares, claims
the highest honour which can belong to any author&mdash;"that of being the inventor of
a new style of writing." But, after this ingratiating prelude, he continues:&mdash;"I
have never read his <cite>Galatea</cite>, nor his <cite>Loves of Persiles and Sigismunda</cite>,
though I have often meant to do it, and I hope to do so yet. Perhaps there is a
reason lurking at the bottom of this dilatoriness. I am quite sure that the
reading of these works could not make me think higher of the author of <cite>Don
Quixote</cite>, and it might, for a moment or two, make me think less." And no
doubt it might: just as the reading of <cite>Hours of Idleness</cite>, of <cite>Zastrozzi</cite>, and of
<cite>Clotilde de Lusignan ou le beau Juif</cite> might, for a moment or two, make us
think less of the authors of <cite>Don Juan</cite>, of <cite>Epipsychidion</cite>, and of <cite>Eugénie Grandet</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlii"></a>[Pg xlii]</span></p>

<p>The <cite>Galatea</cite> survives as the first timorous experiment of a daring genius. It
had no great vogue in Spain, and it is a mistake to say that "seven editions
were called for in the author's lifetime."<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> At least, bibliographers know that, if
they were called for, they certainly did not appear. As a matter of fact the book
was only twice reprinted while Cervantes was alive, and, as neither of these
editions was published in Spain, it is possible that he was unaware of their
existence. In 1590 the <cite>Galatea</cite> was reproduced at Lisbon, expurgated of all
heathenish allusions by Frey Bertholameu Ferreyra, acting for the Portuguese
Inquisition; and this incomplete Portuguese reprint helped to make the pastoral
known outside the Peninsula. It so happened that César Oudin, a teacher of
Spanish at Paris&mdash;where he had already (1608) reprinted the <cite>Curioso impertinente</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>&mdash;travelled
through Spain and Portugal during 1610, and in the course of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliii"></a>[Pg xliii]</span>his journey he unsuccessfully endeavoured to obtain a copy of the Alcalá <cite>Galatea</cite>.
He had to be content with a copy of the mutilated Lisbon edition, and this he
reprinted in 1611 at Paris,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> probably with an eye to using it as a text-book for
his French pupils who were passing through an acute crisis of the pastoral fever.
M. Jourdain had not yet put his embarrassing question to his music and dancing
masters:&mdash;"Pourquoi toujours des bergers?" At all events, there is some
evidence to prove that the <cite>Galatea</cite> was popular in fashionable Parisian circles
while Cervantes still lived. In his <cite>Aprobación</cite> to the Second Part of <cite>Don
Quixote</cite>, the Licenciado Francisco Márquez Torres records that when, on
February 25, 1615, he visited the French embassy, he was beset by members of
the Envoy's suite<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> who, taking fire at the mention of Cervantes's name, belauded
the First Part of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, the <cite>Novelas exemplares</cite>, and the <cite>Galatea</cite>&mdash;which
one of them knew almost by heart.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> It is unlikely that the author himself
knew much of the <cite>Galatea</cite> by heart; but at about this period Honoré d'Urfé<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
had restored the vogue of pastoralism in France, and Márquez Torres's ecstatic
Frenchman (if he really existed) only shewed the tendency to exaggeration
characteristic of recent converts. He was, very possibly, among the last of the
elect in Madrid. One edition&mdash;some say two editions&mdash;of the <cite>Galatea</cite> appeared
posthumously in 1617: two more editions (provincial, like their immediate
predecessor or predecessors) were issued in 1618. Then the dust of a hundred
years settled down on all copies of the forgotten book. Three reprints during
the eighteenth century, ten reprints during the nineteenth century, satisfied the
public demand.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliv"></a>[Pg xliv]</span></p>
<p>The sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries did not produce a single
translation of the <cite>Galatea</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> But in 1783 appeared a French adaptation of this
pastoral by the once famous Chevalier Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> who compressed
the six books of the original into three, added a fourth book of his own
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlv"></a>[Pg xlv]</span>
in which he married Elicio to Galatea, and so contrived a happy ending. "Il
<em>florianise</em> tant soit peu toutes choses," says Sainte-Beuve<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> drily. In this
delicate, perfumed, powder-and-patch arrangement by the idyllic woman-beater<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
and Captain of Dragoons, Cervantes's novel became astonishingly popular. Edition
after edition was struck off from the French presses, and the work was read all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvi"></a>[Pg xlvi]</span>
over Europe in translations: three in German, two in Italian, three in English,
two in Portuguese, one in Greek. Odder still, in this form, the book made its
way home again and, just as certain Spaniards who had forgotten Guillén de
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvii"></a>[Pg xlvii]</span>
Castro enjoyed Juan Bautista Diamante's translation (1658) of Corneille's <cite>Cid</cite>, so
three editions go to prove that, a century and a half later, certain other Spaniards
who had forgotten Cervantes enjoyed Casiano Pellicer's translation (1797) of
Florian's <cite>Galatée</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> And there was more to follow next year. Cándido María
Trigueros<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> showed himself worthy of his Christian name by bettering
Florian's example: he laid violent hands on Cervantes, suppressed here, amplified
there, purged the book of its verses, and supplied a still happier ending&mdash;on
a monumental scale&mdash;by incontinently marrying ten lucky shepherds to ten
lovely shepherdesses. One cannot help wondering what Cervantes would have
thought of this astounding performance. It was too much for the Spanish public,
and Trigueros turned to do better work in adapting old plays to the modern
stage. The taste for Arcadianism died away at the beginning of the nineteenth
century. Artificial pastorals have, indeed, not yet recovered from a polite but
deadly note published in the preface to <cite>Obermann</cite>: "Le genre pastoral, le genre
descriptif out beaucoup d'expressions rebattues, dont les moins tolérables, à mon
avis, sont les figures employées quelques millions de fois et qui, dès la première,
affaiblissent l'objet qu'elles prétendaient agrandir." Such expressions, continues
the writer, are <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'émail des prés</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'azur des cieux</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cristal des eaux</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les lis et
les roses de son teint</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les gages de son amour</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'innocence du hameau</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des</i>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">torrens s'échapperènt de ses yeux</i>&mdash;"et tant d'autres que je ne veux pas condamner
exclusivement, mais que j'aime mieux ne pas rencontrer." Sénancour
was perhaps thinking more particularly of Florian at the moment, but his
criticism applies also to Cervantes's first book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlviii"></a>[Pg xlviii]</span></p>

<p>It was not till 1830 that the first genuine translation of the <cite>Galatea</cite>
appeared, and this German version was followed by two others in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlix"></a>[Pg xlix]</span>
language. These stood alone till 1867<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> when it occurred to a droll, strange man
named Gordon Willoughby James Gyll (or James Willoughby Gordon Gill),<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_l"></a>[Pg l]</span>
publish an English rendering of Cervantes's pastoral in which, as he thought,
"the rural characters are nicely defined; modesty and grace with simplicity
prevailing." Gyll, who wrongly imagined that he was the first to translate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_li"></a>[Pg li]<a id="Page_lii"></a>[Pg lii]</span>
the <cite>Galatea</cite>, seems to have been specially attracted by Cervantes's verses,&mdash;a
compliment which the author would have enjoyed all the more on learning from
his admirer that these "compositions are cast in lyrics and iambics, without
being quite of a dithyrambic character, furnishing relief to the prose, and
evincing the skill and tendency of the bard in all effusions relative to love, the
master-passion of our existence, without which all would be arid and disappointing
to the eagle spirit of the child of song." After this opening you know
what to expect. And you get it&mdash;three hundred and forty-nine pages of it!
Gyll never writes of parts, but of "portions"; rather than leave a place, he will
"evacuate" it; nothing will induce him to return if he can "revert"; he prefers
"scintillations" to gleams, "perturbators" to disturbers, "cogitation" to
thought, and "exculpations" to excuses. Gyll's English, as may be judged
from the specimens just quoted, is almost as eccentric as the English of
Mohindronauth Mookerjee in his <cite>Memoir of the late Honourable Justice
Onoocool Chunder Mookerjee</cite>, and it is much less amusing. His effrontery is
beyond description. He knew nothing of Cervantes whom he actually believed
to be a contemporary of Floridablanca in the eighteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> He almost
implies that he has read Cervantes's lost <cite>Filena</cite>, though he admits that it "is
now rarely found." His ignorance of Spanish is illimitable. How he can have
presumed to translate from it passes all understanding. He misinterprets the
easiest phrases, and he follows the simple plan of translating each word by the
first rough equivalent that he finds given in some poor dictionary. It would be
waste of time to criticize the inflated prose and detestable verse which combine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liii"></a>[Pg liii]<a id="Page_liv"></a>[Pg liv]</span>
to make Gyll's rendering the worst in the world. Two specimens will suffice to
show what Gyll can do when he gives his mind to it. At the very opening of the
First Book, he reveals his powers:&mdash;"But the perspicacity of Galatea detected in
the motions of his countenance what Elicio contained in his soul, and she evinced
such condescension that the words of the enamoured shepherd congealed in his
mouth, though it appeared to him that he had done an injury to her, even to
treat of what might not have the semblance of rectitude." This is Gyll as a
master of prose. Gyll, the lyric poet, is even richer in artistic surprises. Take,
for instance, the closing stanzas of Lauso's song at the beginning of the Fifth
Book:&mdash;</p>

<p>These examples speak for themselves.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Cervantes was not indeed a very great
poet; but his verses are often graceful and melodious, and it would have afflicted
him sorely to see his lines travestied in this miserable fashion. It is inexplicable
that such absolute nonsense should be published. But it is a singular testimony
to the public interest in all concerning Cervantes that, in default of anything
better, this discreditable version should have been read, and even reprinted.</p>

<p>For the present edition a new translation has been prepared. It proceeds on
the one sound principle of translating from the original as faithfully as
possible, without either omission or addition. The task of rendering the
<cite>Galatea</cite> into English is less trying, and therefore less tempting, than the
task of rendering <cite>Don Quixote</cite> or the <cite>Novelas exemplares</cite>; but the <cite>Galatea</cite>
offers numerous difficulties, and it will be found that these have been very
satisfactorily overcome by Dr. Oelsner and Mr. A. Baker Welford. They have
the distinction of producing the first really adequate translation of the <cite>Galatea</cite>
in any language.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The article on Cervantes in Nicolás Antonio's <cite>Bibliotheca Hispana</cite> (Roma,
1672), vol. ii., p. 105, is bibliographical rather than biographical. In Antonio's
time practically nothing was known concerning the details of Cervantes's life.
It is curious that the first writer to attempt a biography of Cervantes was a
foreigner&mdash;possibly Peter Motteux, whose English translation dates from 1700:
a biographical sketch, entitled <cite>An Account of the Author</cite>, was included in
the third volume (London, 1703). The following sentences, which I quote from the
first volume of the third edition (London, 1712), are not without interest:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"For the other Passages of his Life, we are only given to understand that he
was for some time Secretary to the Duke of Alva" (p. ii). "Some are of the
Opinion, that upon our Author's being neglectfully treated by the Duke of Lerma,
first Minister to K. Philip the Third, a strange imperious, haughty Man, and one
who had no Value for Men of Learning; he in Revenge, made this Satyr which,
as they pretend, is chiefly aim'd at that Minister" (pp. iii.-iv.). The biographer
then refers to Avellaneda's spurious sequel, and continues:&mdash;"Our Author was
extremely concern'd at this Proceeding, and the more too, because this Writer
was not content to invade his Design, and rob him, as 'tis said, of some of his
Copy, but miserably abuses poor Cervantes in his Preface" (p. iv.).
</p>
<p>
These idle rumours as to Cervantes's relations with Lerma are taken from
René Rapin's <cite>Réflexions sur la poétique d'Aristote, et sur les ouvrages des
Poetes anciens &amp; modernes</cite> (Paris, 1674, p. 229) and from Louis Moréri's
<cite>Grand Dictionaire historique ou le mélange curieux de l'histoire sacrée
et profane</cite> (Paris, 1687, third edition, vol. i., p. 795); but it is odd to find
them reaching England before they reached Spain. Mayáns and Pedro Murillo
Velarde do not reproduce them till 1737 and 1752 respectively: the first in his
<cite>Vida de Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra</cite> (Briga-Real), and the second in his
<cite>Geographica historica</cite> (Madrid), vol x., lib. x., p. 28.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> See the <cite>Vida de Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra</cite> in Tonson's reprint of <cite>Don
Quixote</cite> (Londres, 1738), vol. i., p. 6. This edition is generally described as Lord
Carteret's edition; but, though Carteret certainly commissioned Mayáns to write
the biography of Cervantes, and though he may have patronized Tonson's venture,
it does not seem so sure that he paid for printing the text (which, as regards the
First Part, is merely a mechanical reproduction of the 1607 Brussels edition).
The usual version of the story is that Carteret, on looking over the library of
Queen Caroline, wife of George II., missed <cite>Don Quixote</cite> from the shelves, and
ordered the sumptuous Tonson edition with a view to making the Queen a present
of the most delightful book in the world. It may be so. Carteret appears to
have been interested in Spanish literature, and we know that Harry Bridges's
translation (Bristol, 1728) of some of the <cite>Novelas exemplares</cite> was brought out
"under the Protection of His Excellency." But, with regard to Carteret's
defraying the entire cost of Tonson's reprint of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, there are some
circumstances which cause one to hesitate before accepting the report as true.
So far as can be gathered, the first mention of Carteret in this connexion is found
in Juan Antonio Mayáns's preface to the sixth edition (Valencia, 1792) of Luis
Gálvez de Montalvo's <cite>Pastor de Fílida</cite>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Carolina, Reina de Inglaterra, muger de Jorge segundo, avia juntado, para
su entretenimiento, una coleccion de libros de Inventiva, i la llamava <cite>La
Bibliotheca del sabio Merlin</cite>, i aviendosela enseñado a Juan Baron Carteret, le
dijo este sabio apreciador de los Escritores Españoles, que faltava en ella la
Ficcion más agradable, que se avia escrito en el Mundo, que era la Vida de D.
Quijote de la Mancha, i que él queria tener el mérito de colocarla" (p. xxv.).
</p>
<p>
This statement, it will be seen, was made more than fifty years after the event
to which it refers. Nevertheless it may be true. Juan Antonio Mayáns may have
had the story from Gregorio Mayáns. He was most unlikely to invent it, and the
fact that he gives 1737 as the date of Gregorio's biography inclines one to believe
in his general accuracy: all other writers give 1738 as the date, but it has
recently been found that a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tirage à part</i> was struck off at Briga-Real (i.e. Madrid)
a year before the <cite>Vida</cite> was printed in London. It must, however, be remembered
that Gregorio Mayáns never met Carteret, and was never in England. Knowing
that Carteret paid him for his share in the work, he might easily have imagined
that Carteret also paid Tonson, and may have been understood to state this
inference as a positive fact. In any case, the memory of an elderly man is not
always trustworthy in such matters as these. Moreover, as Gregorio Mayáns
died in 1781, we must allow for the possibility of error on the part of Juan
Antonio, when repeating a tale that he had heard at least eleven years before.
</p>
<p>
Some external evidence, such as it is, tells against the common belief,
Leopoldo Rius in his <cite>Bibliografía crítica de las obras de Miguel de Cervantes
Saavedra</cite> (Madrid, 1895-1899) notes (vol. ii. p. 300) a German work entitled
<cite>Angenehmes Passetems</cite> (Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1734): in the preface to
this publication it is stated as a piece of news that the Spanish Ambassador in
London, the Conde de Montijo, has ordered a copy of <cite>Don Quixote</cite> to be
handsomely bound for Queen Caroline. We do not know if Montijo gave her
the book, but it seems certain that <cite>Don Quixote</cite> was in her library. A copy
of the Antwerp edition of 1719, bearing her name and the royal crown, passed
into the possession of my friend, the late Mr. Henry Spencer Ashbee: see his
pamphlet, <cite>Some Books about Cervantes</cite> (London, 1900), pp. 29-30. Possibly
the interview with Carteret took place before 1734, or before Queen Caroline
possessed the Antwerp edition. But it is worth noting that the Queen died
on November 20, 1737, and that Tonson's edition appeared next spring. If
Carteret were so deeply engaged in the undertaking as we are assured, and if
his chief motive were (as reported) to pay a courtly compliment to Queen
Caroline, it is strange that he should not have caused the edition to be dedicated
to the Queen's memory, and it is still stranger that the preliminaries should not
contain the least allusion to her. As it happens, the Dedication, dated March 26,
1738, is addressed to the Condesa de Montijo, wife of the ex-Ambassador above-named.
It would be a small but useful service if one of Cervantes's many
English admirers should establish what share Carteret actually had in an enterprise
for which, hitherto, he has received the whole credit.</p></div>

</p>
<p>
It appears that all the assertions here made by Pellicer are mistaken. (1)
Cervantes did not return to Spain in the spring of 1581, but late in 1580; (2) he
did not reside permanently in Madrid during 1581, for we find him at Tomar on
May 21 of that year; (3) if we are to understand that the <cite>Galatea</cite> was composed
in 1684, this is disproved by the fact that the manuscript was passed by the
censor on February 1, 1584, and must naturally have been in his possession for
some time previously; (4) it will be shewn that the <cite>Galatea</cite> was not published
in 1584, but in 1585. Pellicer is not to be blamed for not knowing the real
facts. The pity is that he should give his guesses as though they were
certainties. Yet, in a sense, events have justified his boldness; for no man's
guesses have been more widely accepted.</p></div>

completed some time before; but the passage is too rhetorically, and too
vaguely, worded to admit of safe deductions being drawn from it. The idea

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> The earliest known edition of the <cite>Celestina</cite> is believed to be represented by an
unique copy which was once in Heber's collection. The colophon of this volume is
dated Burgos 1499; but there is some doubt concerning the date inasmuch as the
last page has been recently inserted and may not be a faithful reproduction of
the original printer's mark. It is, however, tolerably certain that this edition
came from the press of Fadrique de Basilea (Friedrich Biel): for whom, see
Conrad Haebler's <cite>Typographie Ibérique du quinzième siècle</cite> (La Haye
and Leipzig, 1901), pp. 30-32. It is also fairly certain that this Heber copy,
whatever its exact date may be, is earlier than the Seville edition of 1501,
reprinted (1900) by M. Raymond Foulché-Delbosc in his <cite>Bibliotheca Hispanica</cite>.
Finally, the probability is that the edition which survives in the Heber volume
was preceded by another edition of which no trace remains: see M. Foulché-Delbosc's

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> Of these perplexing statements it will suffice to note a few which occur in
<cite>Miguel de Cervantes, his life &amp; works by Henry Edward Watts</cite> (London,
1895):
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<em>a</em>) "A new epoch in the life of Cervantes opens in 1584. In that year he
printed his first book...." (p. 76).
</p>
<p>
(<em>b</em>) "A few days before the publication of <cite>Galatea</cite>, Cervantes was married at
Esquivias.... The 12th of December, 1584, was the date of the ceremony."
(p. 90).
</p>
<p>
(<em>c</em>) "Cervantes married his wife in December, 1584, and for reasons which
will be manifest to those who have read the story of his life I think we may
presume that his first book was printed before that date." (p. 257).
</p>
<p>
(<em>d</em>) "The <cite>Galatea</cite>, Cervantes' first book ... was approved for publication
on the 1st of February, 1584, but, for some reason not explained, it was not
published till the beginning of the year following." (p. 87).
</p>
<p>
(<em>e</em>) "Salvá maintains it (<em>i.e.</em> the Alcalá edition of 1585) to be the <em>editio
princeps</em>, but I agree with Asensio and the older critics in believing that
there must have been an edition of 1584." (p. 257).
</p>
<p>
(<em>f</em>) "Navarrete and Ticknor, following all the older authorities, make the
place of publication Madrid and the date 1584. But Salvá has proved in his
Bibliography that the <cite>Galatea</cite> was first published at Alcalá, the author's birthplace,
at the beginning of 1585." (p. 87 <em>n.</em> 3).
</p>
<p>
These sentences do not appear to convey a strictly consistent view: (<em>b</em>) contradicts
(<em>c</em>), (<em>c</em>) contradicts (<em>d</em>), (<em>d</em>) contradicts (<em>e</em>), and (<em>e</em>) contradicts (<em>f</em>).</p></div>

<p> As to (<em>b</em>) and (<em>d</em>), the expressions "a few days" and "the beginning of the new
year" should evidently be interpreted in a non-natural sense. The <em>Tasa</em>, as we
have seen, was not signed at Madrid till March 13, 1585; the next step was to
return the printed sheets to the publisher at Alcalá de Henares; the publisher had
then to forward the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tasa</i> to the printer, and finally the whole edition had to be
bound. In these circumstances, the date of publication cannot easily be placed
earlier than April, 1585. Accordingly, the expression (<em>b</em>)&mdash;"a few days"&mdash;must
be taken to mean about ninety or a hundred days: and "the beginning of the
year," mentioned under (<em>d</em>), must be advanced from January to April.
</p>
<p>
Concerning (<em>e</em>), it is true that Sr. Asensio y Toledo was at one time inclined to
believe in the existence of a 1584 edition of the <cite>Galatea</cite>: see Salvá, <em>op. cit.</em>,
vol ii, p. 124. But Sr. Asensio y Toledo admitted that Salvá's argument had
shaken him: "sus observaciones de V. me han hecho parar un poco." This was
over thirty years ago. Meanwhile, Sr. Asensio y Toledo has revised his opinion,
as may be seen in his latest publication, <cite>Cervantes y sus obras</cite> (Barcelona. 1902).
"En el año 1585 salió á luz <cite>La Galatea</cite>" (p. 268).... "El libro se
imprimió en Alcalá, por Juan Gracián, y es de la más extremada rareza" (pp. 382-383).
He now accepts Salvá's view without reserve.
</p>
<p>
As to (<em>f</em>), I have searched Navarrete's five hundred and eighty pages and
Ticknor's one thousand six hundred and ninety-seven pages, but have been
unable to find that either of them gives Madrid as the place of publication. An
exact reference to authorities is always advisable.</p></div>

Dr. Pérez Pastor sums up the case concisely in the <cite>Prólogo</cite> to his <cite>Documentos

Cervantes han sostenido que éste asistió á la jornada de la Tercera, fundándose en
que así lo indica en el pedimento de la Información del año 1590; pero si tenemos
en cuenta que en dicho documento van englobados los servicios de Miguel y
Rodrigo de Cervantes, y por ende que es fácil atribuir al uno los hechos del otro
hermano, que Miguel estaba en Tomar por Mayo de 1581, en Cartagena á fines
de Junio de este año, ocupado en cosas del servicio de S. M., y en Madrid por el
otoño de 1583, que el Marqués de Santa Cruz, después de haber reducido la Tercera
y otras islas, entró en Cádiz el 15 de Septiembre del dicho año, se hace casi

The decisive point is that Ticknor's copy, the oldest known edition, must be at
least as late as 1554, for Montemôr here refers to the Infanta Juana as a widow:
see (lib. iv.) the fifth stanza of the <cite>Canto de Orfeo</cite>. Her husband, Dom João,
died on January 2, 1554. A duplicate of the Ticknor volume is in the British

Ribeiro's work seems to have been printed posthumously, the earliest known

Vasconcellos observes (p. 295, <em>n.</em> 8): "Dass lange vor dem ital. Drucke Ribeiro's

Handschriften oder Flugblättern unter den Lesenden Kurs gehabt haben." It is,

book esteemed by Gallardo, Gayangos, and Salvá (<em>op. cit.</em>, vol. i., p. 153,

<p><a id="Footnote_51" href="#FNanchor_51" class="label">[51]</a> The reference is, no doubt, to the passage in the fifth book of Montemôr's
<cite>Diana</cite>: "Y tomando el vaso que tenía en la mano izquierda le puso en la suya á
Sireno, y mando que lo bebiese, y Sireno lo hizo luego; y Selvagia y Silvano
bebieron ambos el otro, y en este punto cayeron todos tres en el suelo adormidos,
de que no poco se espantó Felismena y la hermosa Belisa que allí estaba...."
Cp. Sannazaro's <cite>Arcadia</cite> (<cite>Prosa nona</cite>, Scherillo's edition, p. 171): "Al quale
subgiunse una lodula, dicendo, in una terra di Grecia (dela quale yo ora non so il
nome) essere il fonte di Cupidine, del quale chiunche beve, depone subitamente
ognie suo amore."</p>

<p>The expedient of the magic water, to which Cervantes refers once more in the
<cite>Coloquio de los Perros</cite> (see vol. viii. of the present edition (Glasgow, 1902),
p. 163), seems to be as old as most things in literature. Scherillo, in his valuable
commentary to the <cite>Arcadia</cite> cites a parallel from Pliny, <cite>Naturalis Historia</cite>,
lib. xxxi., cap. 16: "Cyzici fons Cupidinis vocatur, ex quo potantes amorem
deponere Mucianus credit."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="label">[52]</a> It is just possible, however, that Cervantes may have omitted the <cite>Habidas</cite>
deliberately; for though Ticknor (<em>op. cit.</em>, vol. iii., p. 99, <em>n.</em> 18), on the authority
of Gayangos, quotes the book as "among the earliest imitations of the Diana," so
excellent a scholar as Professor Rennert (<em>op. cit.</em>, p. 111) inclines to think "that
it is rather a 'Novela Caballeresca.'"</p></div>

<p>These sallies have brought down on Cervantes the displeasure of implacable bibliographers.
Salvá y Mallen (<em>op. cit.</em>, vol. ii., pp. 19-20, no. 1518) drily observes
that, as the book is almost wholly in verse, it does not at all correspond to Cervantes's
description of it, and he gives us to understand (what most readers have
realised for themselves) that, in criticism of his contemporaries, Cervantes&mdash;like
the rest of the world&mdash;is prone to err.</p>

<p>See also <cite>Cervantes vascófilo ó sea Cervantes vindicado de su supuesto
antivizcainismo por Julián Apráiz y Sáenz del Burgo, Natural de
Vitoria y vizcaino, alavés y guipuzcoano por todos sus abolengos</cite>. Nueva
edición considerablemente aumentada (Vitoria, 1895), pp. 270-274. In a note
(p. 274) to his letter addressed (April 23, 1884), to Sr. D. José Colá y
Goiti, Dr. Apráiz&mdash;who courageously sets himself to prove that Cervantes, so
far from disliking the Basques as has been generally supposed, had in fact the
highest opinion of them&mdash;points out that <cite>Los nueve libros de las Habidas</cite>
take no more space than a 16mo. volume. "Y una vez leída la obra del
poeta navarro insisto, tanto en que no hay más prosa que brevísimos renglones del
argumento de la obra, como acerca del mérito que le reconocen Rosell, Gayangos
y Vedia, y Gallardo, mucho más habida cuenta de la temprana edad de 20 años
que tenía el poeta al escribir su poema, según el mismo dice al dirigirse á la
señora (<em>i.e.</em> Doña Adriana de Egues y de Biamonte), á quien lo dedica. Parece
que había muerto 3 años antes de la publicación de su poema."
</p>
<p>
If Arbolanche (or Arbolanches) really died in 1563, it is almost impossible that
Cervantes can have had&mdash;as has been insinuated&mdash;any personal grudge against
him. Perhaps he had read the <cite>Habidas</cite> when he was a lad, was bored, and in his
old age exaggerated his impression, without remembering very clearly the contents
of the book. Or, it may be, as Dr. Apráiz suggests (<em>op. cit.</em>, pp. 273-274),
that Cervantes mistook Arbolanche (or Arbolanches) for the author of some dull
pastoral whose name escaped him. If this be so, it is exceedingly regrettable
that he should twice have made the same blunder: for the consequence has been
that the name of Arbolanche (or Arbolanches), a poet of distinct merit, has
become&mdash;among those who have not read him and who follow Cervantes blindly&mdash;a
synonym for a ridiculous prose writer. Cp. the lines in the celebrated <cite>Sátira
contra los malos escritores de su tiempo</cite> by Jorge Pitillas (<em>i.e.</em> José Gerardo de

his <cite>Prosa duodecima</cite> alludes apologetically, but with excellent reason, to <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">il mio
picciolo Sebetho</i>, Cervantes in his sixth book, with no reason of any sort,
introduces <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">las frescuras del apacible Sebeto</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[65]</a> Cervantes, as appears from a somewhat confused allusion early in the seventh
chapter of the First Book of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, seems to have been one of the few
(besides the author) who enjoyed <cite>Carlos famoso</cite>. Zapata himself complained
with a comic ruefulness that his forty thousand lines were not widely appreciated,
and that he was out of pocket in consequence: "Yo pensé también que en haber
hecho la historia del Emperador Carlos V., nuestro señor, en verso, y dirigídola á
su pio y poderosísimo hijo, con tantas y tan verdaderas loas de ellos y nuestros
españoles, que había hecho algo. Costóme cuatrocientos mil maravedís la ímpresión,
y de ella no saqué sino saña y alongamiento de mi voluntad." Zapata,
however, consoles himself with thinking that he is in good company and closes
with a pious, confident moral: "De Homero se dice que en su vida no se
hizo de él caso, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et sua riderunt tempora Meonidem</i>. Del autor del famoso
libro poético de Amadís no se sabe haste hoy el nombre, honra de la nacion y
lengua española, que en ninguna lengua hay tal poesía ni tan loable.... De
manera que podemos decir todos el <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic vos non vobis</i> de Virgilio, por lo cual
todos de paso y como accesorio deben no poner su felicidad acá, donde no hay
ninguna, sino atender á aquello que Dios les ha prometido; que si plantaren la
viña de las buenas obras, gozarán perpétuamente del fruto de ella y otro no se la
vendimiará." See Zapata's <cite>Miscelánea</cite> in the <cite>Memorial histórico español</cite>
(Madrid, 1859), vol. xi., pp. 304-305. It is interesting to note that Zapata
hazards no guess as to the authorship of <cite>Amadís de Gaula</cite>.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[67]</a> Sannazaro's latest and best editor, Signor Scherillo, is properly sceptical
(<em>op. cit.</em>, pp. clxxvi.-ccviii.) as to many current identifications of the personages
in the <cite>Arcadia</cite>. It seems certain that Barcinio is Chariteo of Barcelona,
and that Summontio is Pietro Summonto, the Neapolitan publisher of the book.
It is probable that Meliseo is Giovanni Pontani, and that Massilia is the author's
mother. It is possible that Sincero is Sannazaro. But, as Signor Scherillo drily
observes, it is not easy to follow those who think that Sannazaro was Ergasto,
Elpino, Clonico, Ophelia, and Eugenio&mdash;not "three gentlemen at once," but five.
Other writers hold that Ophelia is Chariteo; that Pontano is Ergasto, Opico and
Montano; that Eleuco is the Great Captain; and that Arcadia stands for France.
These and similar absurdities are treated as they deserve in Signor Scherillo's
masterly introduction.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">[68]</a> The supposition that Tirsi, in the <cite>Pastor de Fílida</cite>, was intended to represent
Cervantes is noted by Navarrete (<em>op. cit.</em>, p. 278), and on the authority of
that biographer has been frequently repeated. It is right to say that Navarrete
simply mentions the identification in passing, and that he is careful to throw all
responsibility for it on Juan Antonio Mayáns who was the first to suggest the idea
in the introduction to his reprint of the <cite>Pastor de Fílida</cite> (Valencia, 1792), pp.
xxxvii, lxxvii, and lxxx. The theory has been disproved by Juan Antonio
Pellicer (<em>op. cit.</em>, p. cxxxiii.)
</p>
<p>
There can be no reasonable doubt that the Tirsi of the <cite>Pastor de Fílida</cite> is
Francisco de Figueroa. It is absolutely certain that the Tirsi of the <cite>Galatea</cite> is
Figueroa: for, in the Second Book, Cervantes places it beyond question by
ascribing to Tirsi two sonnets and a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">canción</i> by Figueroa. Cp. <cite>Poesías de
Francisco de Figueroa, llamado el Divino</cite> (Madrid, 1804).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> This is not, however, the opinion of Eustaquio Fernández de Navarrete
(<em>op. cit.</em>, p. xxxii): "Puede sospecharse que la primer heroína de su novela no
fué doña Catalina Palacios de Salazar, con quien Cervantes casó á poco tiempo de
publicar su libro, sino que lo escribió en Portugal durante sus amores con una
dama de aquel país, á quien debió grandes obligaciones; y que después cuando
volvió a España, al trabar relaciones con doña Catalina, retocó la obra y la
acomodó al nuevo sugeto." This story of Cervantes's relations with an anonymous
Portuguese lady, supposed to be the mother of his illegitimate daughter, was
generally accepted till 1895. It was never anything more than a wild guess
and, thanks to Dr. Pérez Pastor, we now know that there is no truth in it.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand Sr. D. Ramón León Máinez, in his <cite>Vida de Miguel de
Cervantes Saavedra</cite> (Cádiz, 1876), pronounces very emphatically in favour of
the current identifications as regards the hero and the heroine: "En Elicio se ve
con mucha perfección la imagen de Cervantes. Galanteador, tímido, discreto,
delicado, sentidisimo, su amor es tan casto como los pensamientos de su alma.
Adora más que ama; venera más que pretende" (p. 69). "Ningún otro personaje
puede encubrir á Elicio sino Cervantes: ninguna otra señora puede
velarse bajo la figura de Galatea sino Doña Catalina de Palacios. Son los
retratos al natural de dos seres privilegiados, de dos personas ilustres, de dos
amantes que más ó menos encubiertamente se tributaban el homenaje de su
adoracion." (p. 71.)
</p>
<p>
It will be observed that Sr. D. Ramón León Máinez takes things very
seriously.</p></div>

that Cervantes's reference in <cite>Don Quixote</cite> to Bernardo González de
Bobadilla's <cite>Nimphas y Pastores de Henares</cite>, a pastoral published at Alcalá
in 1587, denotes some irritation against one whom he possibly regarded as a
poacher. What really happened was that, during the diverting and important
scrutiny of the Knight's library, the Barber came upon González de Bobadilla's
book, together with Bernardo de la Vega's <cite>Pastor de Iberia</cite> and Bartolomé
López de Enciso's <cite>Desengaño de los celos</cite>. The Priest directed the Barber to
"hand them over to the secular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or
we shall never have done." On the strength of this, some genial contemporaries

<p><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">[90]</a> It may be convenient to point out that the <cite>Arcadia</cite> mentioned in the text is a
play published in the <cite>Trezena Parte de las Comedias de Lope de Vega Carpio</cite>
(Madrid, 1620) and should not be confounded with Lope's pastoral novel, the <cite>Arcadia</cite>
(Madrid, 1598). This warning will appear unnecessary to Spanish scholars.
But the bibliography of Lope's works is so vast and intricate that a slip may
easily be made. For example, Mr. Henry Edward Watts (<cite>Life of Miguel
de Cervantes</cite>, London, 1891, p. 144) at one time mistook Lope's <cite>Dorotea</cite> for
the <cite>Arcadia</cite>, assuming the former to be a pastoral novel. This very curious
error is corrected in the same writer's <cite>Miguel de Cervantes, his life &amp; works</cite>
(London, 1895, p. 200, <em>n.</em>) with the remark that "if any blunder is excusable
in a writer it is that of not remembering the name of one of Lope's multitudinous
productions." In the same work we are assured (p. 111) that of all Lope's plays
"there are not half-a-dozen whose names are remembered to-day out of Spain;
nor one character, scene or line which any one not a member of the Spanish Royal
Academy cares to recall." If ignorance has really reached this point, the
caution given in the opening words of this note may be useful to the general
reader.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="label">[91]</a> Sr. D. Ramón León Máinez, in an exuberant paragraph, sketches out (<em>op. cit.</em>,
p. 71) the continuation as he believes Cervantes to have conceived it: "Si más
tarde hubiera cumplido su promesa de estampar la segunda parte de aquella obra
bellísima, que indudablemente dejó escrita al morir, y fué una de las producciones
suyas inéditas que se perdieron; cuán deleitosa y dulcemente hubiera hablado en
ella de la prosecución de sus amores, de la fina correspondencia en lo sucesivo
para con él por parte de su idolatrada doncella, del allanamiento de dificultades,
del progreso de sus aspiraciones y de la realización de sus deseos! Allí nos
hubiera descrito con la perfección, dulzura y encanto que él sabíalo hacer, el
regocijo de su alma, la felicidad de su amada, el vencimiento de su contrario, los
esmeros y desvelos de los amigos, el beneplácito de sus deudos, y su bien logrado
casamiento con doncella tan ilustre, de tal hermosura y virtud adornada. El
relato de las bodas estaría hecho en la segunda parte de <cite>Galatea</cite> con encantadora
sencillez, y con amenidad incomparable, como trabajo al fin de mano tan maestra
y acreditada."
</p>
<p>
This prophecy tends to allay one's regret for the non-appearance of the
<cite>Galatea</cite>; but it is exceedingly possible that Sr. Máinez knows no more of
Cervantes's intentions than the rest of us.</p></div>

No mentemos esa innumerabilidad de composiciones que aparecieron antes y después
de 1584. Comparar con ellas la concepción de Cervantes, sería ofender la memoria
de este autor esclarecido" (p. 67). "<cite>La Galatea</cite> no sólo es una obra superior
entre todas las pastorales españolas, mirada en cuanto á la inventiva: es también
mejor que las que antes y después de su aparición se publicaron, considerada
bajo el punto de vista de la forma y de los méritos literarios" (p. 79). Cp. also
a passage on p. 65: "Tal vez ninguno de los idiomas modernos pueda ofrecer tan
preciadas concepciones como en este género presentan las letras castellanas." The
biographer notes the weak points of Montemôr's <cite>Diana</cite>, of Gil Polo's <cite>Diana
enamorada</cite>, of Lope de Vega's <cite>Arcadia</cite> (the novel, not the play), of Suárez de
Figueroa's <cite>Constante Amarilis</cite>, of Valbuena's <cite>Siglo de oro</cite>, and concludes
(p. 68): "el talento de Cervantes era tan grande, tan superior, tan de eximio y
delicado gusto, que supo evitar todos esos vicios, olvidarse de todos los defectos,
para imitar lo bueno, y ofrecer una obra, en lo posible, perfecta. Vense en ella
acción dramática, vitalidad, episodios interesantísimos, escenas amenas, gracia,
seducción, hermosura. El ánimo se solaza y dulcemente se regocija al presenciar
tal conjunto de preciosidades."
</p>
<p>
Sr. Máinez praises (p. 80), as a model of style, a passage in the First Book of the
<cite>Galatea</cite>, beginning: "En las riberas de Betis, caudalosísimo río que la gran
Vandalia enriquece, nació Lisandro (que éste es el nombre desdichado mío), y de
tan nobles padres, cual pluguiera al soberano Dios que en más baja fortuna fuera
engendrado." Scherillo points out, however (<em>op. cit.</em>, p. cclv), that this is
modelled upon the opening of Sincero's story in the <cite>Prosa settima</cite> of Sannazaro's
<cite>Arcadia</cite>: "Napoli (sicome ciaschuno molte volte può avere udito) è nela più
fructifera et dilectevole parte de Italia, al lito del mare posta, famosa et nobilissima
città.... In quella dunque nacqui io, ove non da oscuro sangue, ma
(se dirlo non mi si disconviene) secondo che per le più celebre parti di essa città
le insignie de' miey predecessori chiaramente dimostrano: da antichissima et
generosa prosapia disceso, era tra gli altri miei coetanei forse non il minimo
riputato."</p></div>

Friedrich von Schlegel is no less rapturous in prose. See his corybantics in the
periodical entitled <cite>Athenaeum</cite> (Berlin, 1799), vol. ii., pp. 325-326. After referring
to Cervantes as the author of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, Schlegel continues: "der aber doch
auch noch andre ganz ehr-und achtbare Werke erfunden und gebildet hat, die
dereinst wohl ihre Stelle im Allerheiligsten der romantischen Kunst finden werden.
Ich meyne die liebliche und sinnreiche Galatea, wo das Spiel des menschlichen
Lebens sich mit beschneidner Kunst und leiser Symmetrie zu einem künstlich
schönen Gewebe ewiger Musik und zarter Sehnsucht ordnet, indem es flieht. Es
ist der Blüthekranz der Unschuld und der frühsten noch schücternen Jugend."
He repeated his enthusiastic appreciation in the following year (<cite>Athenaeum</cite>,
Berlin, 1800, vol. iii., p. 80): "Da Cervantes zuerst die Feder statt des Degens
ergriff, den er nicht mehr führen konnte, dichtete er die Galatea, eine wunderbar
grosse Composition von ewiger Musik der Fantasie und der Liebe, den zartesten
und lieblichsten aller Romane." ...</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99" class="label">[99]</a> The following statement occurs in <cite>Miguel de Cervantes, his life &amp; works
by Henry Edward Watts</cite> (London, 1895), p. 179, <em>n.</em> 1: "This French
ambassador, called by the Spanish commentators the <cite>Duque de Umena</cite>, must
have been the Duc de Mayenne, who was sent by the Regent Anne of Austria,
to conclude the double marriage of the Prince of Asturias (afterwards Philip IV.)
with Isabelle de Bourbon, and of Louis XIII. of France with the Infanta Ana,
eldest daughter of Philip III."
</p>
<p>
The familiar formula&mdash;"must have been"&mdash;is out of place here. The
necessity does not exist. It seems unlikely that Márquez Torres can have met
the members of Mayenne's suite on February 25, 1615; for Mayenne's mission
ended two and a half years previously. Mayenne and his attachés left Madrid
on August 31, 1612: see Luis Cabrera de Córdoba, <cite>Relaciones de las cosas
sucedidas en la Córte de España, desde 1599 hasta 1614</cite> (Madrid, 1857),
p. 493, and François-Tommy Perrens, <cite>Les Mariages espagnols sous le règne
de Henri IV. et la régence de Marie de Médicis, 1602-1615</cite> (Paris, 1869),
pp. 403 and 416-417. "Umena" is, as everybody knows, the old Spanish form
of Mayenne's title; but no Spaniard ever dreamed of applying this title to the
ambassador of whom Márquez Torres speaks. As appears from a letter (dated
February 18, 1615) to "old Æsop Gondomar," the special envoy to whom
Márquez Torres refers was known as "Mr. de Silier": see Navarrete, <em>op. cit.</em>,
pp. 493-494. Mr. de Silier was the brother of Nicolas Brûlart, Marquis de
Sillery, Grand Chancellor of France from September, 1607, to May, 1616. The
special envoy figures in French history as the Commandeur Noel Brûlart de
Sillery: he and his suite reached Madrid on February 15, 1615 (Navarrete, <em>op.
cit.</em>, p. 493), and they left that city on March 19, 1615 (Perrens, <em>op. cit.</em>,
p. 519). One might have hoped that, as M. de Sillery founded the mission of
Sillery near Quebec, his name would be known to all educated Englishmen. His
death on September 26, 1640, is mentioned by his confessor, St. Vincent de Paul,
in a letter to M. Codoing, dated November 15, 1640. See <em>Lettres de S. Vincent
de Paul</em> (Paris, 1882), vol. i., p. 100.
</p>
<p>
I do not know who the above-mentioned "Regent Anne of Austria" is supposed
to be. The French Regent who sent Mayenne and Sillery to Spain was Marie de
Médicis, mother of Louis XIII. Her regency ended in 1615. In 1615 Anne of
Austria, sister of Philip IV., became the wife of Louis XIII. Her regency began
in 1643. It would almost seem as though the earlier French Queen-Regent had
been mistaken for her future Spanish daughter-in-law, or, as though the writer
were unaware of the fact that the "Regent Anne of Austria" and the "Infanta
Ana" were really one and the same person. But the whole passage indicates
great confusion of thought, as well as strange misunderstanding of Navarrete's
words and of the document printed by him.
</p>
<p>
An old anecdote, concerning Cervantes and a French Minister at the Spanish
Court, is inaccurately reproduced in <cite>Camoens: his Life and Lusiads. A
Commentary by Richard F. Burton</cite> (London, 1881), vol. i., p. 71: "Cervantes,
who had been excommunicated, whispered to M. de Boulay, French Ambassador,
Madrid, 'Had it not been for the Inquisition, I should have made my book much
more amusing.'" Sir Richard Burton evidently quoted from memory, and, as his
version is incorrect, it may be advisable to give the idle tale as it appeared
originally in <cite>Segraisiana ou Mélange d'histoire et de littérature. Recueilli
des Entretiens de Monsieur de Segrais de l'Académie Françoise</cite> (La Haye,
1722), p. 83: "Monsieur du Boulay avoit accompagné Monsieur * * * dans son
Ambassade d'Espagne dans le tems que Cervantes qui mourut en 1618 vivoit
encore: il m'a dit que Monsieur l'Ambassadeur fit un jour compliment à Cervantes
sur la grande réputation qu'il s'étoit acquise par son <cite>Dom Quixotte</cite>, au de-là
des monts: &amp; que Cervantes dit à l'oreille à Monsieur l'Ambassadeur, sans
l'Inquisition j'aurois fait mon Livre beaucoup plus divertissant."
</p>
<p>
It will be observed that M. du Boulay was not Ambassador; that he does not
pretend to have heard Cervantes's remark; that he merely repeats the rumour of
what Cervantes was alleged to have whispered to M. * * * (who may, or may
not, be M. de Sillery); and that he does not mention the Ambassador as his
authority for the story. Moreover, Jean Regnauld de Segrais was born in 1624,
and died in 1701. Assuming that he was no more than thirty when he met M.
du Boulay, this would mean that the story was told nearly forty years after the
event. If the volume entitled <cite>Segraisiana</cite> was compiled towards the end of
Segrais' life, we are at a distance of some eighty years from the occurrence. In
either case, there is an ample margin for errors of every kind.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_100" href="#FNanchor_100" class="label">[100]</a> Gregorio Mayáns y Siscar suggests (<em>op. cit.</em>, vol. i., pp. 28-29) that the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Aprobación</i>, though signed by Márquez Torres, was really written by Cervantes
himself: "57 ... Pensarà el Letor que quien dijo èsto, fué el Licenciado
Màrquez Torres; no fué sino el mismo Miguèl de Cervantes Saavedra: porque el
estilo del Licenciado Màrquez Torres, es metaforico, afectadillo, i pedantesco;
como lo manifiestan los <cite>Discursos Consolatorios que escriviò a Don Christoval
de Sandoval i Rojas, Duque de Uceda en la Muerte de Don Bernardo de
Sandoval i Rojas, su hijo, primer Marquès de Belmonte</cite>; i al contrario el
estilo de la <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Aprovacion</i>, es puro, natural, i cortesano, i tan parecido en todo al
de Cervantes, que no ai cosa en él que le dístinga. El Licenciado Màrquez era
Capellán, i Maestro de Pages de Don Bernardo Sandoval i Rojas, Cardenal,
Arzobispo de Toledo, Inquisidor General; Cervantes era mui favorecido del
mismo. Con que ciertamente eran entrambos amigos.
</p>
<p>
"58. Supuesta la amistad, no era mucho, que usase Cervantes de semejante
libertad. Contèntese pues el Licenciado Màrquez Torres, con que Cervantes le
hizo partícipe de la gloria de su estilo. I veamos que moviò a Cervantes a querer
hablar, como dicen, por boca de ganso. No fué otro su designio, sino manifestar
la idea de su Obra, la estimacion de ella, i de su Autor en las Naciones estrañas,
i su desvalimiento en la propia."
</p>
<p>
Navarrete protests (<em>op. cit.</em>, pp. 491-493) against the theory put forward by
Mayáns, notes that Márquez Torres published his <cite>Discursos</cite> in 1626 when
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">culteranismo</i> was in full vogue, and contends that he may have written in much
better style eleven years earlier.
</p>
<p>
It would be imprudent to give great importance to arguments based solely on
alleged differences of style. That Márquez Torres was in holy orders, and that
he was appointed chaplain to a prelate so virtuous and clear-sighted as the
Cardinal-Archbishop of Toledo are strong presumptions in his favour. Nothing
that is known of him tends to discredit his testimony. It would be most
unjustifiable to assume of any one in his responsible position that he was capable
of inventing an elaborate story from beginning to end, and of publishing a tissue
of falsehoods to the world. Nor can we lightly suppose that Cervantes would
lend himself to such trickery. The probability surely is that there is some
good foundation for the anecdote, though perhaps the tale may have lost nothing
in the telling.
</p>
<p>
Still, the history of literature furnishes analogous examples of persons who
tampered with preliminary matter&mdash;dedications and the like&mdash;and stuffed these
pages with praises of themselves. Le Sage evidently refers to a recent incident
in real life when he interpolates the following passage into the revised text of <cite>Le
Diable boiteux</cite> (Rouen, 1728), pp. 37-38: "A propos d'Epîtres Dédicatoires,
ajoûta le Démon, il faut que je vous raporte un trait assez singulier. Une femme
de la Cour aiant permis qu'on lui dédiât un ouvrage, en voulut voir la Dédicace
avant qu'on l'imprimât, &amp; ne s'y trouvant pas assez bien loüée à son gré, elle prit
la peine d'en composer une de sa façon &amp; de l'envoier à l'Auteur pour la mettre à
la tête de son ouvrage."
</p>
<p>
A somewhat similar instance is afforded by La Rochefoucauld, who asked
Madame de Sablé to review his <cite>Pensées</cite> in the <cite>Journal des Savants</cite>. The lady
thoughtfully submitted the manuscript of her article to the author, and the result
is recorded by Hippolyte Cocheris, <cite>Table méthodique et analytique des articles
du Journal des Savants depuis sa réorganisation en 1816 jusqu'en 1858
inclusivement précédée d'une notice historique sur ce journal depuis sa
fondation jusqu'à nos jours</cite> (Paris, 1860), pp. vi.-vii. "Larochefoucauld prit
au mot Mme de Sablé; il usa très-librement de son article, il supprima les
critiques, garda les éloges, et le fit insérer dans le <cite>Journal des Savants</cite> (1665,
p. 116 et suiv.), ainsi amendé et pur de toute prétention à l'impartialité."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="label">[101]</a> The full title of d'Urfé's book is <cite>L'Astrée, où par plusieurs histoires et sous
personnes de bergers et d'autres sont déduits les divers effects de l'Honneste
Amitié</cite>. The date of publication has long been doubtful; it is now, apparently,
established that the First Part, consisting of twelve books, was originally
issued in 1607. Only one copy of this edition is known to exist. For a
description of this unique volume, discovered by M. Edwin Trossat at Augsburg
in 1869, see the <cite>Catalogue des livres du baron James de Rothschild</cite> (Paris,
1887), vol. ii. p. 197, no. 1527.
</p>
<p>
D'Urfé had been preceded by Nicolas de Montreux who, under the anagrammatic
pseudonym of Olenix du Mont-Sacré, had published the five volumes
entitled <cite>Les Bergeries de Juliette</cite> at Paris between 1585 and 1598: see Heinrich
Koerting, <cite>Geschichte des französichen Romans im <small>XVII.</small> Jahrhundert</cite>
(Oppeln und Leipzig), vol. i., pp. 66-68. But, though Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac
declares (<cite>Œuvres complètes</cite>, Paris, 1665, vol. ii. p. 634) that <cite>Les Bergeries de
Juliette</cite> was long preferred to <cite>Astrée</cite> by French provincials during the seventeenth
century, Montreux found so little favour in Paris, that he abandoned
pastoralism, and took to writing a history of the Turks instead: see Émile Roy,
<cite>La Vie et les œuvres de Charles Sorel, sieur de Souvigny, 1602-1674</cite> (Paris,
1891), pp. 115-116. It was d'Urfé who made the pastoral fashionable. Part of
his immediate vogue may be attributed to the fact that his Euric, Galatée,
Alcidon and Daphnide were supposed to represent Henri IV., Marguerite de Valois,
the Duc de Bellegarde, and the Princesse de Conti. These dubious identifications,
however, would not explain the enthusiasm of readers so different in taste and
character, and so far apart in point of time, as St. François de Sales, Madame de
Sévigné, Prévost (the author of <cite>Manon Lescaut</cite>), and Rousseau. There is no
accounting for tastes, and perhaps Márquez Torres's polite Frenchman sincerely
admired the <cite>Galatea</cite>; but indeed he had left a far better pastoral at home.
<cite>Astrée</cite> greatly exceeds the <cite>Galatea</cite> in achievement, importance, and significance.
M. Paul Morillot is within the mark in saying: "<cite>L'Astrée</cite> de d'Urfé est vraiment
notre premier roman; elle est l'ancêtre, la source de tous les autres" (<cite>Le Roman
en France</cite>, p. 1). He perhaps grants too much by his admission (p. 27) that "de
nos jours <cite>L'Astrée</cite> est tout à fait oubliée." A useful <cite>Index de "L'Astrée"</cite> by
Saint-Marc Girardin proves that the book has had passionate admirers down to our
time: see the <cite>Revue d'Histoire littéraire de la France</cite> (Paris, 1898), vol. v.,
pp. 458-483 and 629-646. The <em>Index</em> has an interesting prefatory note by M.
Paul Bonnefon.</p></div>

works.
</p>
<p>
It has hitherto been uncertain whether No. (5) really existed or not. It is
noted by Nicolás Antonio (<em>op. cit.</em>, vol. ii., p. 105). This Baeza edition is also
mentioned under the heading of <cite>Romans historiques</cite> by Gordon de Percel who,
in all likelihood, simply copied the note from Antonio: see <cite>De l'usage des
romans où l'on fait voir leur utilité &amp; leurs differens caracteres avec une</cite>
<cite>Bibliothèque des romans, accompagnée de remarques critiques sur leur
choix et leurs éditions</cite> (Amsterdam, 1734), vol. ii., p. 108. Despite the imprint
on the title-page, this work was actually issued at Rouen: see a valuable article
in the <cite>Revue d'Histoire littéraire de la France</cite> (Paris, 1900, vol. vii.,
pp. 546-589) by M. Paul Bonnefon who describes Gordon de Percel&mdash;the pseudonym
of the Abbé Nicolas Lenglet du Fresnoy&mdash;as an odious example of an odious type,
carrying on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier d'espion sous couleur d'érudit</i>.
</p>
<p>
There can now, apparently, be no doubt that an edition of the <cite>Galatea</cite> was
printed at Baeza in 1617, for Rius (<em>op. cit.</em>, vol. i., p. 104) states that he
possesses a letter from the Marqués de Jerez, dated September 14, 1890, in which
the writer explicitly says a copy of this edition was stolen from him at Irún. I
do not at all understand what Rius can mean by the oracular sentence which
immediately precedes this statement: "No tengo noticia de ejemplar alguno,
ni sé que nadie la (<em>i.e.</em> la edición) haya visto."
</p>
<p>
It has been remarked in the text of this Introduction (p. xxxv) that Cervantes
applies the word <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">discreta</i> with distressing frequency to his heroine and her sister
shepherdesses. The repetition of this adjective appears to have produced a considerable
impression on the Lisbon publisher, Antonio Álvarez, for his edition&mdash;No.
(6) in the above list&mdash;is entitled <cite>La discreta Galatea</cite>. No. (5) is also said
to be entitled <cite>La discreta Galatea</cite>. But on this point no one, save the Marqués
de Jerez de los Caballeros, can speak with any certainty.</p></div>

into French in 1618. This is a mistake. Koerting was probably thinking of the
<cite>Novelas exemplares</cite>. Six of these (<cite>La Española inglesa</cite>, <cite>Las dos Doncellas</cite>,
<cite>La Señora Cornelia</cite>, <cite>La Ilustre fregona</cite>, <cite>El Casamiento engañoso</cite>, and the

Florian est antipathique. En traduisant <cite>Don Quichotte</cite>, Florian a changé le
mouvement de l'air, la clef de la musique de l'auteur original. Il a appliqué aux
épanchements d'une veine abondante et riche les sautillements et les murmures
d'un ruisseau: petits bruits, petits mouvements, très-agréables sans doute quand
il s'agit d'un filet d'eau resserré qui roule sur des cailloux, mais allure insupportable

Concerning the writer I have gathered the following particulars: they are to
some extent derived from statements scattered up and down his works. For the
references to <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> I am particularly indebted to Mr. W. R.
Morfill, the distinguished Reader in Slavonic at the University of Oxford.
</p>
<p>
Our Gyll was born on August 1, 1803 (<cite>History of Wraysbury</cite>, p. 100), being
the third son of William Gill (at one time an officer in the army), and the grandson
of a City alderman. William Gill, the elder, was a partner in the firm of
Wright, Gill, and Dalton, wholesale stationers in Abchurch Lane, London. He was
elected alderman in 1781, served as Sheriff in 1781-1782, was appointed Treasurer
of Christ's Hospital in 1784-1785, and in due course became Lord Mayor for
1788-1789. He died in the Treasurer's house at Christ's Hospital on March 26,
1798, being then seventy-four years of age: his brother-in-law and partner,
Thomas Wright, died on April 9, 1798. An obituary note in <cite>The Gentleman's
Magazine</cite> (vol. lxviii., p. 264) states that the elder William Gill "was a
respectable tradesman and died immensely rich." The younger William Gill
died on February 16, 1806, at the age of thirty-one. I do not know to what
school Gordon Willoughby James Gill was sent. He speaks of himself as "a
member of the University of Oxford" (<cite>A Tractate on Language</cite>, First Edition,
p. iii.). This is confirmed by the appended note in the Matricula Book, which
am enabled to print through the kindness of my friend Mr. H. Butler Clarke:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"From the Register of Matriculations of the University of Oxford. 1822 Jan.
15. Coll. Pemb. Gordon Willoughby Jacobus Gill, 18, Gulielmi, de par. S.
Mariæ bonæ Arm. fil. 3<sup>ius</sup>.
</p>
<p>
A true extract, made 30 Jan<sup>y.</sup>, 1903 by T. Vere Bayne, Keeper of the Archives."
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this entry is not an autograph: all the other entries on the
page which contains it are, as the Keeper of the Archives informs me, in the
same handwriting. The <cite>Oxford University Calendar</cite> for 1823 gives (p. 275)
our author's names in this form and sequence: James Willoughby Gordon Gill.
This form and order are repeated in the <cite>Oxford University Calendar</cite> for the
years 1824 and 1825. In the alphabetical index to the <cite>Calendar</cite> for 1823-1824-1825
this Pembroke undergraduate is entered as: <cite>Gill, James G. W.</cite>
As the editors of the semi-official <cite>Calendar</cite> derive their information from the
College authorities, we may take it that, from 1822 to 1825 inclusive, the future
author passed as James Gill at Pembroke, and amongst those who knew him
best. It cannot be supposed that the Master and Fellows of Pembroke made
a wrong return for three consecutive years, nor that they wilfully reversed the
order of Gill's Christian names with the express object of annoying him. Had
they done either of these things, Gill was the very man to protest energetically:
his conduct in later years snows that he was punctilious in these matters.
However, it is right to bear in mind that the Matricula Book gives Gill's
Christian names in the same order as they appear on his title-pages. I have
failed to obtain any details of his career at Pembroke. Mr. Wood, the present
Librarian at Pembroke, states that there is "no proper record" of the Commoners
at that College in Gill's time. On this point I have only to say that the poet
Thomas Lovell Beddoes was in residence at Pembroke with Gill, and that
information concerning Beddoes's undergraduate days is apparently not lacking.
Possibly more careful research might discover some trace of Gill at Oxford. He
seems to have taken no degree, and to have left no memory or tradition at
Pembroke. He himself tells us (<cite>A Tractate on Language</cite>, First Edition, p. iii)
that when at Oxford "he formed an acquaintance with a gentleman of considerable
erudition, but not of either University, who had made the English tongue his
peculiar care." To this association we owe <cite>A Tractate on Language</cite>, and,
perhaps, the peculiarities of style which Gill afterwards developed. But, in
the latter respect, a serious responsibility may attach to Milton; for, in his
<cite>Tractate</cite>, Gill refers to the poet and laments (p. 224) that, at the period of which
he speaks, "the Allegro and Penseroso were confined to the closets of the
judicious." The inference is that Gill modelled his diction on both these poems.
</p>
<p>
His name disappears from the <cite>Oxford University Calendar</cite> in 1826. He
visited Mexico in 1832 (<cite>History of Wraysbury</cite>, p. 49), and perhaps during this
journey he picked up a queer smattering of Spanish. On August 29, 1839, he
married "Anne Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Bowyer-Smijth, Bt.," and
this seems to have given a new direction to what he calls his "studious tendencies."
</p>
<p>
The founder of his wife's family was plain William Smith, who died in 1626;
this William Smith's son developed into Thomas Smyth, and died a baronet in
1668; Sir Thomas Smyth's great-great-grandson, the seventh baronet, was
known as Sir William Smijth, and died in 1823. Gill's father-in-law,&mdash;Vicar of
Camberwell and Chaplain to George IV.&mdash;was the ninth baronet. On June 10,
1839, he assumed the name of Bowyer by royal license, and was styled Sir
Edward Bowyer-Smijth. In this the Vicar was practically following the lead of
his younger brother, a captain in the 10th Hussars, who assumed the name of
Windham by royal license at Toulouse on May 22, 1823, and thenceforth signed
himself Joseph Smijth-Windham. The contagion infected Gill.
</p>
<p>
After his marriage to Miss Bowyer-Smijth, third daughter of the ninth baronet,
Gill became a diligent student of genealogy, heraldry and county-history. It might
be excessive to say that he was attacked by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">folie des grandeurs</i>; but he does
appear to have felt that, since the Smiths had blossomed into Bowyer-Smijths and
Smijth-Windhams, a man of his ability was bound to do something of the same
kind for the ancient house of Gill. And something was done: a great deal, in
fact. The first-fruits of Gill's enterprise are garnered in <cite>The genealogy of the
family of Gylle, or Gill, of Hertfordshire, Essex and Kent, illustrated by
wills and other documents</cite> which he printed in 1842. At this first stage he
acted with praiseworthy caution, signing his pamphlet with the initials G. G.
If he was ever known by so vulgar a name as James&mdash;the name of the
patron-saint of Spain&mdash;he had evidently got rid of it by 1842. At Pembroke
in 1823 his initials were J. G. W. G., according to the <cite>Oxford University
Calendar</cite>: nineteen years later they were G. G. This advancement passed
unnoticed, and the delighted investigator continued his researches. These were
so successful that, according to Gill's shy confession wrung from him long afterwards,
"as the old annals, parish registers, tombs, wills. &amp;c., wrote our name
Gyll, we, by sign manual, returned to that orthography in 1844": (see <cite>Notes
and Queries</cite>, March 24, 1866, vol. ix., p. 250). The English of this avowal is
bad, but the meaning is clear. Henceforward Gill is transfigured into Gyll.
These easy victories led him to enlarge his plan of campaign, and thus we
find in the 1846 edition of <cite>Burke's Landed Gentry</cite> the pedigree of the family
of Gyll of Wyrardisbury, which contains the statement that on October 13,
1794, the head of the house (of the Gylls of Wyrardisbury), "William Gyll,
Esquire, Captain 2nd Regiment Life Guards, and Equerry to H. R. H. the Duke of
Sussex" married "Lady Harriet Flemyng, only child of the Right Hon. Hamilton
Flemyng, last Earl of Wigtoun, and had issue" our author, and other children
with whom we are not concerned here.
</p>
<p>
According to George Lipscomb's <cite>History and Antiquities of the County
of Buckingham</cite> (London, 1847, vol. iv., p. 605, <em>n.</em> 1.), it was on December 17,
1844, that "Her Majesty was pleased ... to permit the family of Gyll of
Wyrardisbury, to resume the ancient orthography of their name." The enthusiastic
Gyll (as we must now call him) interpreted the privilege in a generous
fashion. It galled the patrician to think that his grandfather had been a lowly
alderman, and to know that this lamentable fact was on record at Wraysbury.
There were epitaphs in Wraysbury Church describing his grandfather as "Alderman
of the City of London"; describing his father as "only son of Alderman
Gill"; describing his aunt, Mrs. Paxton, as "daughter of William Gill, Esq.,
Alderman of the City of London." Our Gyll had all these odious references to
the aldermanship removed; in their stead he introduced more high-sounding
phrases; he interpolated the statement that his grandfather was "of the family
of Gyll of Wyddial, Herts"; and on all three monuments he took it upon himself
to change Gill into Gyll. The changes were made clumsily and unintelligently,
but one cannot have everything. Gordon Gyll was indefatigable in his pious
work, and, within three years, he somehow induced Lipscomb (<em>op. cit.</em>, vol. iv.,
p. 604) to insert a pedigree connecting the family of "Gyll of Buckland and
Wyddial Hall, co. Herts, Yeoveny Hall, co. Middlesex, and Wyrardisbury Hall,
co. Bucks," with certain Gylls established in Cambridgeshire during the reign of
Edward I. It is impossible not to admire the calm courage with which the still,
strong man swept facts, tombstones, epitaphs, and obstacle's of all kinds from the
path of his nobility.
</p>
<p>
His proceedings passed unnoticed during fourteen happy years. At last
attention was drawn to them in <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> (May 11, 1861, p. 365) by a
correspondent who signed himself "A Stationer." "A Stationer" remarked
sarcastically on the erasure of all references to the aldermanship from the monuments
in Wraysbury Church, noted that the dead Gills had been glorified into
Gylls, deplored Gordon Gyll's ingratitude towards the ancestors to whom he owed
everything, censured Gyll's conduct as "silly," and protested against such tampering
as improper. The editor of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> supported "A Stationer's"
view on the ground that monuments had hitherto been accepted as testimony in
suits at law, and that their evidential value would be completely destroyed if
Gyll's example were generally followed. Gyll put on his finest county manner,
and replied in an incoherent letter (<cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, May 26, 1861, p. 414)
which breathes the haughty spirit of a great territorial chieftain. He denounced
the insolence of "A Stationer" in daring to criticize "a county family," branded
the intruder as a "tradesman," a "miserable citizen critic," and pitied the poor
soul's "confined education." But he failed to explain his conduct satisfactorily,
and laid himself open to the taunts of Dr. J. Alexander (<cite>Notes and Queries</cite>,
June 8, 1861, p. 452), who declared that Gyll had "proved himself unable to
write English, and ignorant of some of the simplest rules of composition." Dr.
Alexander added that,&mdash;if a licence obtained in 1844 could justify changing the
spelling of the name of a man who died in 1798,&mdash;by parity of reasoning, "had
the worthy alderman accepted the proferred baronetcy, all his ancestors would,
<em>ipso facto</em>, become baronets. I believe China is the only country where this
practice obtains." In the same number of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, "A Stationer"
returned to the subject, and posed a number of very awkward questions. "Are
the Gylls really a county family? And when did they become so? Has any
member of the house ever filled the office of Knight of the shire, or even that of
sheriff for the county of Buckingham?" And, after reproaching Gyll for his
repudiation of his hard-working grandfather, "A Stationer" ended by assuring
the proud squire that "the Stationers of London have a more grateful recollection
of their quondam brothers and benefactors&mdash;for benefactors they were to a very
unequal extent. From Alderman Wright, the Stationers received 2000<em>l.</em> 4 per
cents.: from Alderman Gill (who left a fortune of £300,000) 30<em>s.</em> a year to be
added to Cator's dinner. However, their portraits are still to be seen in the
counting-house of the Company, placed in one frame, side by side. "<cite>Par nobile
fratrum!</cite>" Gyll dashed off a reply which the editor of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>
(June 29, 1861, p. 520) declined to insert: "as we desire to avoid as much as
possible any intermixture of personal matters into this important question." At
this the blood of all the Gylls boiled in the veins of Gordon Willoughby James.
He was not to be put off by a timorous journalist, and he secured the insertion in
<cite>Notes and Queries</cite> (July 27, 1861, p. 74) of an illiterate letter which, says the
editor, "we have printed ... exactly as it stands in the original." The letter
seems to have been written under the influence of deep emotion, for the aristocratic
Gyll twice speaks of his grandfather as a "party." He demanded an
ample apology, and ended with the announcement that "if I do not hear from
you I shall send the family lawyer to meet the charge." Gyll did not obtain the
apology, did not attempt to answer "A Stationer's" string of questions, did not
accept the editor's offer to print the suppressed letter, did not "send the family
lawyer to meet the charge." In fact he did nothing that he threatened to do, and
nothing that he was asked to do. If he consulted his solicitor, the latter probably
joined with the editor and told him not to make a fool of himself.
</p>
<p>
But Gyll had no idea of abandoning his pretensions, and he renewed them with
abundant details in his <cite>History of Wraysbury</cite>, a quarto which contains more
than its title implies. He is not content to note (p. 153) that "occasionally
those dreary landmarks in the vast desert of human misery, called Coroner's
inquests, arise in Wraysbury." He also proves, to his own satisfaction, that "the
family of Ghyll, Gyll, Gylle, Gille, Gill, for it is recorded in all these ways, is
derived from that one which resided in the North, temp. Edward the Confessor,
1041, at Gille's Land in Cumberland" (p. 99), and that "in 1278 Walter le Gille
served as a juryman at Tonbridge" (p. 98). The arms of the Gylls are duly
given: "Sable, two chevrons argent, each charged with three mullets of the field,
on a dexter Canton, or; a lion passant at guard, gules. Also Lozenges or and
vert; a lion rampant at guard, gules." Heralds whom I have consulted have
jeered at the Gyll escutcheon, but I cannot bring myself to give their ribald remarks
in print. Apparently, the main purpose of the <cite>History of Wraysbury</cite> is to
shew that the Gylls (with a <em>y</em>) are very Superior Persons, and that the Gills
(with an <em>i</em>) are People of No Importance. Gyll admits that the latter produced a
worthy man in the person of John Gill, "a Baptist divine"; and the historian,
when writing of his poor relations (p. 125), emphasizes the fact that John Gill
was not an Anabaptist. Anabaptists were evidently an inferior set.
</p>
<p>
It will be seen that Gyll traced back his pedigree to a period earlier than the
Norman Conquest: six centuries before his wife's ancestors (then known as
Smith) were first heard of. It was a great achievement and henceforth no Gyll
need fear to look a Bowring-Smijth in the face. And Gyll's ambition grew. He
could not prove that he was the child of a baronet, and, in so much, he was in a
position of social inferiority to his wife. But he did the next best thing by declaring
that, if he was not the son of a baronet, he easily might have been. In his
<cite>History of Wraysbury</cite>, he states (p. 97) that his grandfather was Lord Mayor
of London when George III. went to St Paul's to give thanks for his recovery
from his first attack of insanity, that the usual patent "was prepared and
announced in all the public papers, 18th and 19th April, 1789, to create him a
Baronet, which is usual when the King honours the city on any great occasion,
but the profered advancement was not accepted for family reasons. Nor was the
claim revived until his son "William Gyll, Captain 2nd Life Guards, who had in
1803 at his own expense raised two troops of cavalry at the threat of invasion,
solicited the favour which his father had injudiciously declined, when he too
unfortunately died prematurely, and the expected honour has not since been
conferred." This is a repetition of a favourite phrase: for Lipscomb (<em>op. cit.</em>,
vol. iv., p. 605, <em>n.</em> 3) states that the younger William Gyll "unfortunately died
suddenly, and the expected honour has not since been conferred." One can guess
the source of Lipscomb's information.
</p>
<p>
I regret to say that Gyll throws all the blame for this catastrophe on his
grandmother, as may be seen by an intemperate foot-note which follows the
passage just quoted from the <cite>History of Wraysbury</cite>: "His (the Lord Mayor's)
wife Mary induced him to forego the honour, because there was a son by his first
wife, who only survived a few years and died unmarried. Women may be very
affectionate but not discreet. They have a fibre more in their hearts, and a cell
less in their brains than men." This is most improper, no doubt. Still, great
allowance should be made for the exasperation of a man who longed to be a
baronet's son, who might have been one, and who was not.
</p>
<p>
Gyll had certainly played his part gallantly. Considering the material that he
had to use, he worked wonders. He had (perhaps) transformed himself from
James to Gordon; he had (unquestionably) evolved from Gill to Gyll. He had
wiped out the horrid memory of the aldermanship, and had buried the old
stationer's shop miles beneath the ground-floor of limbo. And there is testimony
to his social triumphs in the list of subscribers that precedes his <cite>History of
Wraysbury</cite>, which is dedicated "by permission" to the late Prince Consort.
Among the subscribers were two dukes, two earls, five barons, ten baronets:
and these great personages were followed by Mr. Disraeli, Mr. Milner Gibson, the
Dean of Windsor, the Provost of Eton, and other commoners of distinction.
</p>
<p>
It was a glorious victory which Gyll enjoyed in peace for four years. Then his
hour of reckoning came. A correspondent of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, signing himself
"Anglo-Scotus," pointed out (February 24, 1866, p. 158) that the statement concerning
the Gylls in <cite>Burke's Landed Gentry</cite> was erroneous; that no officer
named Gyll ever held a commission in either regiment of the Life Guards; that
Hamilton Flemyng was not the last (or any other) Earl of Wigtoun; and that
consequently no such person as Lady Harriet Flemyng ever existed. Gyll pondered
for a month and then, at last, nerved himself to write to <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>
(March 24, 1866, p. 250) asserting that Hamilton Flemyng was "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per legem
terrae</i>, 9th and last Earl of Wigton." His letter was thought to be too rambling
for insertion: the editor confined himself to printing this crucial passage, and
referred Gyll to the report of the Committee for Privileges which set forth that
"the claimant (Hamilton Flemyng) hath no right to the titles, honours, and
dignities claimed by his petition." This report was quoted in the same number of
<cite>Notes and Queries</cite> (pp. 246-247) by an Edinburgh correspondent signing himself
G., and G. went on to say that, though no Gyll ever held a commission in the
Life Guards, a certain William Gill figures in the Edinburgh Almanacs for
1794-5-6 as a Lieutenant in the 2nd Life Guards. I have since verified this
statement, and I find that William Gill was gazetted to the 2nd Life Guards
on September 26, 1793. In spite of the interest that he took in his family
history, Gyll had no accurate knowledge of his father's doings. William Gill
was transferred to the Late 2nd Troop of Horse Grenadier Guards (a reduced
corps receiving full pay) on March 23, 1796, and he retired on March 19, 1799
(see <cite>The London Gazette</cite>, Nos. 13,878 and 15,116). But Gyll was ever a
muddler and a bungler. He informed Lipscomb that his father had "died
suddenly" (<em>op. cit.</em>, vol. iv., p. 605); while, in the <cite>History of Wraysbury</cite>
(p. 121), he copies an epitaph recording William Gill's death "after a long and
painful illness."
</p>
<p>
It was thus established that the family name was Gill; that the younger
William Gill did not marry the daughter of the last Earl of Wigton (or Wigtoun);
that he was never a Captain in the 2nd Life Guards; and that in 1803, when he
was alleged to have raised two troops of cavalry, he had already resigned his
commission four years. Human nature being what it is, this exposure may have
brought a smile to the lips of the Bowyer-Smijths who had listened to Gyll's
stories of a cock and of a bull for a quarter of a century. Gyll collapsed at once
when detected, and he published no more results of his genealogical researches.
It is a pity, for who knows to what length of absurdity he might not have gone?
Who knows, indeed, whether his little tale of the Lord Mayor and the baronetcy
is not of a piece with the rest? I have searched the contemporary newspapers,
and the nearest approach that I can find to a confirmation of Gyll's assertion is
in <cite>The Diary; or Woodfall's Register</cite> (Friday, April 24, 1789): "That the
Lord Mayor will be a Baronet is now certain; and that Deputies Seekey and
Birch will be knighted is extremely probable." I do not know what happened to
Seekey and Birch. The Gylls are enough for a lifetime. Years afterwards a
correspondent to <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> (December 26, 1876, p. 512) derisively
observed that "the Gyll family, however, quarter the Flemyng arms, and also the
Flemyng crest." But the badger was not to be drawn a third time: Gyll
endured the affront in the meekest silence.
</p>
<p>
The versatile man had relieved his severe antiquarian studies by excursions
into light literature. <cite>A Tractate on Language</cite> was published because, as the
author avows (p. iii), "he thought (perhaps immaturely) that some occult
treasures and recondite truths in philology were eliminated, and were worthy
public consideration." When Gyll wrote these words (1859) he was in his fifty-seventh
year, and was as mature as he was ever likely to be. The work, which
contains the alarming statement (p. 171) that "Noah taught his descendants
his matricular tongue," seems to have been rudely handled by critics. In the
second edition of his <cite>Tractate</cite> Gyll replies with the ladylike remark that "as
regards his opinions, it was not consistent with equity or delicacy that they
should have been encountered with <em>savage phrenzy</em>;" and, with a proper
contempt for reviewers, he adds that "while such reviews indulge thus
indiscriminately, pourtraying sheer obliquity of mind and judgment in lieu of
that <em>manly acumen</em> to which they pretend, the critics must perceive how much
below the dignity of the criticised it is to evince uneasiness or resentment&mdash;both
as easily 'shaken off as dewdrops from the lion's mane.'" It is unlikely that
Gyll is widely read nowadays, and this is my excuse for doing what I can to
save two distinguished aphorisms from the wreck of his <cite>Tractate</cite>. There is
nothing like them (it is safe to say) in Pascal or La Rochefoucauld.
</p>
<p>
(<em>a</em>) "As in religion what is bones to philosophy is milk to faith" (pp. iii-iv).
</p>
<p>
(<em>b</em>) "A literary man, however, is like a silkworm employed and wrapped up in
his own work" (p. 163).
</p>
<p>
After his exposure in <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> Gyll dropped genealogy, heraldry,
and topography as though they were so many living coals. But, though he
dreaded the fire, he was still bent on making the world ring with the name of Gyll.
Spanish literature, which was at that time cultivated in these islands by such
men as Chorley, FitzGerald, Archbishop Trench, Denis Florence Mac-Carthy and
Ormsby, seemed to him a promising field in which he should find no dangerous
rivals. In the <cite>History of Wraysbury</cite> (p. 146) he included his own name
among the "names of literary and distinguished characters of Wraysbury," and
under the date 1860, he mentions his "Translation from the Spanish of Don
Guzmán de Alfarache." I presume this was a version of Mateo Alemán's
picaresque novel, but I can find no trace of it. At the age of sixty-four the
extraordinary Gyll furbished up the few words of Spanish which he had learned
in Mexico thirty-five years earlier, and courageously started as a translator of
Cervantes. His versions are the worst ever published in any tongue. But
criticism was impotent against his self-complacency. A true literary man, he
lived&mdash;to use his own happy phrase&mdash;"like a silkworm employed and wrapped
up in his own work." On the whole his was a prosperous career. Carpers
might do their worst, but the solid facts remain. Gyll had practically blotted
out the stain of the stationer's shop and the aldermanship; he had obtained permission
to write his name with a <em>y</em>: he had elbowed his way into county-histories,
into Burke's <cite>Landed Gentry</cite> and into Burke's <cite>General Armory</cite>; he had
published such works as, in all probability, the world will never see again. He
appreciated these performances to the full, and he revelled in gazing on the south
window in Wraysbury Church, of which he writes (<cite>History of Wraysbury</cite>,
p. 123): "At the summit are two small openings of painted glass, and in the
centre is a quatrefoil in which the letters G. W. J. G. are convoluted.... The
play of colours on the monuments when the sun is brilliant, affords a pleasing
variegation." What more could the mind of man desire? Gordon Willoughby

from <cite>Los seis libros de Galatea</cite>, reprinted in 1784 by Antonio de Sancha with a
dedication to Floridablanca. The words&mdash;"Dedicated by Cervantes"&mdash;are interpolated
by Gyll. Floridablanca died in 1808, nearly two hundred years after

<p><a id="Footnote_113" href="#FNanchor_113" class="label">[113]</a> In justice to Gyll, the polemist, I reprint his two letters contributed to <cite>Notes
and Queries</cite> (May 25, 1861, and July 27, 1861):&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(<em>a</em>) "A S<small>TATIONER</small> writes his remarks on the subject of some alterations on
lapidary inscriptions in Wraysbury Church: and pray, Sir, by what right does
this tradesman ask any family why they choose to change a monumental reading,
provided nothing is inserted which militates against truth?
</p>
<p>
What has the world to do with family arrangements? And whether is the
article to be taken for a <em>charge</em> or a <em>lament</em>? I only wish this busy citizen to
employ his time more profitably&mdash;while I wonder that any periodical should
condescend to introduce the subject, without notice being given to members of the
family, and an inquiry made. If they had reasons good for it, what on earth
does the public care about it? Certain words on certain monuments were not
approved by a county family, and they were omitted: and lo! a citizen rises to
impeach the <em>proprietary</em> of it. The case stands thus, Monument No. 1:
</p>
<p>
This was an unusually large slab, on which the simple record of the deaths of
Wm. Gyll, Esq., and his wife, were only inscribed. The family thought the space
might be occupied by the addition of other family names, &amp;c.&mdash;and it was done.
And now the slab is full.
</p>
<p>
No. 2. Wm. Gyll, Esq., was styled here Equerry to H.R.H. Duke of Sussex;
but that he was also Captain in the 2nd Life Guards was omitted. It was
deemed expedient to make room for its insertion, and it was done.
</p>
<p>
No. 3. On Mrs. Paxton's monument, a daughter of Wm. Gyll, Esq., the latter
gentleman is styled <em>of this parish</em>; and as he had considerable property here, it
was his proper designation. Room was made to effect this, and it was done.
</p>
<p>
There are thirteen monuments to the family of Gyll, or relations, in the chancel
of Wraysbury Church; and where the patronymic was spelt with an <em>i</em> as formerly,
instead of <em>y</em> as latterly, a change was made that these names might correspond
with the same orthography on other monuments (see Chauncey &amp; Clutterbuck,
<em>Herts</em>), and with antique deeds (see <cite>Collectanea Topographica</cite>, vol. viii.).
</p>
<p>
The family for many years had returned to the <em>original</em> mode of spelling their
patronymic, to distinguish them from other families similarly called; and for this
privilege a permission was obtained by <em>sign manual</em> in 1844. And if a correspondent
change was made on the monuments, what has anyone in the world to do
with it but the family?
</p>
<p>
In one case a mistaken date was inscribed, 17th for 26th March. This is made
a <em>charge and a crime</em> by this miserable citizen critic, as if these mistakes were
made purposely.
</p>
<p>
In two cases Dr. Lipscomb's monumental inscriptions give <em>widow</em> for wife, and
<em>Sept.</em> for April. Had the S<small>TATIONER</small>, who is so wonderfully correct, and turns
all things to wrongs, gone or sent to Wraysbury, he would have found <em>his</em>
improvements already on the monuments.
</p>
<p>
But his candid soul converts all this to <em>vanity</em>: and, no doubt, vanity finds
endless occupation for ingenuity and invention. Suggests that a family ought to
be proud of civic honours. Many thanks to the <em>suggestive</em> S<small>TATIONER</small>; but if
this family is not, what cares the world about it? It may have gained nothing
by the position; but if he will be <em>obtrusive</em>, let him tell the next editor who is in
want of matter another <em>secret</em>&mdash;for he uses <em>this term</em> in his disquisition&mdash;that Mr.
Gyll, in 1789, refused to be created a Baronet, and that the patent was made out
and was ready for execution. See the newspapers <em>passim</em>, 18th and 23rd April,
1789.
</p>
<p>
It may be the family desires no remembrance of the honours conferred, or the
honours proffered; and if so, what daring presumption gives a S<small>TATIONER</small> a plea
to impugn any act done by A. or B., and parade it before the public in an
accommodating journal? His confined education may preclude his knowing that
a Lord Stanhope doffed his title and removed his arms from all his carriages; and
that Horace Walpole remarked, that calling him "My Lord," was calling him
<em>names</em> in his old age. Many have not assumed honours to which they were
entitled.
</p>
<p>
As the S<small>TATIONER</small>, or the poor malice of the writer under this name, has made
a <em>charge</em>, I trust, Sir, in your <em>equity</em>, that you will insert this explanation in your
next number; and I also trust to read in your most interesting and useful
publication, for the future, more that <em>concerns</em> the curious world than that a
family substituted on a monument a <em>y</em> for an <em>i</em>, and withheld altogether the
naming of an honour which might have appeared there.

</p>
<p>
(<em>b</em>) "As you have not published the letter I sent to your office in answer to that
of A S<small>TATIONER</small>, and also to an LL.D., who, instead of quietly confining himself
to an opinion on a point of law, rushed into <em>personalities</em> quite unjustified by
circumstances, for no letter was addressed to him unless he be the S<small>TATIONER</small> in
disguise, who, in his arrogance dared to say that I was ignorant of the first
principles of composition&mdash;I wish to know whether the LL.D. or S<small>TATIONER</small>
mean to assert that by our improving certain monuments in Wraysbury Church
(which we, as a family acting in unison, were entitled to do without the interference
of anyone) we have falsified them.
</p>
<p>
If that be intended, we consider the allegation <em>false and injurious</em>, and unless
we have an unequivocal denial, we shall refer the case to our legal adviser. The
entire object of the S<small>TATIONER</small> was to insult our family, and to impute motives,
which was enough to incite to resentment.
</p>
<p>
If he had politely said that we had caused one letter to be substituted for
another, which did not change the sound of the name, and had put in a Christian
name where the title of a civic honour was inscribed, whereby the party was more
<em>clearly</em> identified&mdash;for Mr. Alderman A. may be anybody&mdash;it had been well and
harmless, and no such letter, which he terms acrimonious, had been written.
</p>
<p>
You gave, in a note to my letter, an opinion that the question was <em>not touched</em>.
Now, Sir, I wish to ask you or the LL.D. if any L<small>AW</small> is violated, and if a family
has a right to inscribe on a monument that A. or B. were Deputy-Lieut., Magistrates,
M.P., or High Sheriffs? and if so, if a party is termed Alderman where his
proper description would be Lord Mayor, the family may not legally and
judiciously alter it?
</p>
<p>
We stand impeached with <em>breaking a law</em>, and by implication with, <em>falsifying</em>
a lapidary inscription. We wish to know if <em>these imputations</em> are meant either
by LL.D. or the S<small>TATIONER</small>, for if they are, let the case be tried before proper
tribunal, or else let us have a denial. If I do not hear from you I shall send the
family lawyer to meet the charge.

<p>Your Lordship's worth has prevailed with me so much as to
take away from me the fear I might rightly feel in venturing to
offer you these first-fruits of my poor genius. Moreover, considering
that your August Lordship came to Spain not only to
illumine her best Universities, but also to be the pole-star by
which those who profess any real science (especially those who
practise that of poetry) may direct their course, I have not
wished to lose the opportunity of following this guidance, since
I know that in it and by it all find a safe haven and a favourable
reception. May your Lordship be gracious to my desire, which
I send in advance to give some kind of being to this my small
service; and if I do not deserve it for this, I may at least deserve
it for having followed for several years the conquering banners of
that Sun of warfare whom but yesterday Heaven took from
before our eyes, but not from the remembrance of those who
strive to keep the remembrance of things worthy of it, I mean
your Lordship's most excellent father. Adding to this the feeling
of reverence produced in my mind by the things that I, as in
prophecy, have often heard Cardinal de Acquaviva tell of your
Lordship when I was his chamberlain at Rome; which now are
seen fulfilled, not only by me, but by all the world that delights
in your Lordship's virtue, Christian piety, munificence, and
goodness, whereby you give proof every day of the noble and
illustrious race from which you descend; which vies in antiquity
with the early times and leaders of Rome's greatness, and in
virtues and heroic works with equal virtue and more exalted
deeds, as is proved to us by a thousand true histories, full of the
renowned exploits of the trunk and branches of the royal house
of Colonna, beneath whose power and position I now place
myself to shield myself against the murmurers who forgive
nothing; though, if your Lordship forgive this my boldness, I
shall have naught to fear, nor more to desire, save that our Lord
may keep your Lordship's most illustrious person with the increase
of dignity and position that we your servants all desire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PROLOGUE.</h2>
</div>


<p>C<small>URIOUS</small> R<small>EADERS</small>,</p>

<p>The occupation of writing eclogues, at a time when poetry
is generally regarded with such little favour, will not, I fancy, be
counted as so praiseworthy a pursuit, but that it may be necessary
especially to justify it to those who, following the varying tastes
of their natural inclination, esteem every taste differing from it
as time and labour lost. But since it concerns no man to justify
himself to intellects that shut themselves up within bounds so
narrow, I desire only to reply to those who, being free from
passion, are moved, with greater reason, not to admit any
varieties of popular poetry, believing that those who deal with
it in this age are moved to publish their writings on slight consideration,
carried away by the force which passion for their
own compositions is wont to have on the authors. So far as
this is concerned, I can urge for my part the inclination I have
always had for poetry, and my years, which, having scarcely
passed the bounds of youth, seem to permit pursuits of the kind.
Besides, it cannot be denied that studies in this art (in former
times so highly esteemed and rightly) carry with them no inconsiderable
advantages: such as enriching the poet (as regards
his native tongue); and acquiring a mastery over the tricks of
eloquence comprised in it, for enterprises that are loftier and
of greater import; and opening a way so that the narrow souls
that wish the copiousness of the Castilian tongue to be checked
by the conciseness of the ancient speech, may, in imitation of
him, understand that it offers a field open, easy, and spacious,
which they can freely traverse with ease and sweetness, with
gravity and eloquence, discovering the variety of acute, subtle,
weighty, and elevated thoughts, which, such is the fertility of
Spanish men of genius, Heaven's favourable influence has
produced with such profit in different parts, and every hour
is producing in this happy age of ours, whereof I can be a sure
witness, for I know some men who, with justice and without the
impediment I suffer, could safely cover so dangerous a course.
But so common and so diverse are men's difficulties, and so
various their aims and actions, that some, in desire of glory,
venture, others, in fear of disgrace, do not dare, to publish that
which, once disclosed, must needs endure the uncertain, and
well-nigh always mistaken, judgment of the people. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
given proof of boldness in publishing this book, not because I
have any reason to be confident, but because I could not determine
which of these two difficulties was the greater: whether
that of the man who, wishing to communicate too soon the
talent he has received from Heaven, lightly ventures to offer the
fruits of his genius to his country and friends, or that of him
who, from pure scrupulousness, sloth, or dilatoriness, never quite
contented with what he does and imagines, counting as perfect
only that which he does not attain, never makes up his mind to
disclose and communicate his writings. Hence, just as the daring
and confidence of the one might be condemned, by reason of
the excessive license which accompanies security; so, too, the
mistrust and tardiness of the other is vicious, since late or never
does he by the fruits of his intellect and study benefit those
who expect and desire such aids and examples, to make
progress in their pursuits. Shunning these two difficulties, I
have not published this book before now, nor yet did I desire to
keep it back longer for myself alone, seeing that my intellect
composed it for more than for my pleasure alone. I know well
that what is usually condemned is that no one excels in point of
the style which ought to be maintained in it, for the prince of
Latin poetry was blamed for having reached a higher level in
some of his eclogues more than in others; and so I shall not
have much fear that any one may condemn me for having
mingled philosophical discourses with some loving discourses of
shepherds, who rarely rise beyond treating of things of the field,
and that with their wonted simplicity. But when it is observed
(as is done several times in the course of the work) that many
of the disguised shepherds in it were shepherds only in dress,
this objection falls to the ground. The remaining objections
that might be raised as regards the invention and ordering
may be palliated by the fixed intention of him who reads, if he
will do so with discretion, and by the wish of the author, which
was to please, doing in this what he could and actually did,
achieve; for even though the work in this part do not correspond
to his desire, he offers others, yet to come, of better
taste and greater art.</p>

<p class="p01">Thus on the banks of the Tagus sang Elicio, a shepherd on
whom nature had lavished as many gifts as fortune and love had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
withheld; though the course of time, that consumes and renews
man's handiwork, had brought him to such a pass, that he
counted for happiness the endless misfortunes in which he had
found himself, and in which his desire had placed him, for
the incomparable beauty of the peerless Galatea, a shepherdess
born on those same banks. Although brought up in pastoral
and rustic exercises, yet was she of so lofty and excellent an
understanding, that gentle ladies, nurtured in royal palaces,
and accustomed to the refined manners of the Court, counted
themselves happy to approach her in discretion as in beauty,
by reason of the many noble gifts with which Heaven had
adorned Galatea. She was loved and desired with earnest
passion by many shepherds and herdsmen, who tended their
herds by the banks of the Tagus: amongst whom the gay Elicio
made bold to love her, with a love as pure and honest, as the
virtue and modesty of Galatea allowed. It must not be thought
of Galatea that she despised Elicio, still less that she loved him:
for, at times, almost persuaded, as it were, and overcome by the
many services of Elicio, she with some modest favour would
raise him to heaven; and, at other times, without taking account
of this, she would disdain him in such wise, that the love-sick
shepherd scarce knew his lot. The excellencies and virtues
of Elicio were not to be despised, nor were the beauty, grace,
and goodness of Galatea not to be loved. On the one hand,
Galatea did not wholly reject Elicio; on the other, Elicio could
not, nor ought he to, nor did he wish to, forget Galatea. It
seemed to Galatea, that since Elicio loved her with such regard
to her honour, it would be too great an ingratitude not to reward
his modest thoughts with some modest favour. Elicio fancied
that since Galatea did not disdain his services, his desires would
have a happy issue; and, whenever these fancies revived his
hope, he found himself so happy and emboldened, that a
thousand times he wished to discover to Galatea what he kept
concealed with so much difficulty. But Galatea's discretion well
knew from the movements of his face what Elicio had in his
mind; and she gave such an expression to hers that the words
of the love-sick shepherd froze in his mouth, and he rested
content with the mere pleasure of that first step: for it
seemed to him that he was wronging Galatea's modesty in
treating of things that might in some way have the semblance
of not being so modest, that modesty itself might
take their form. With these up and downs the shepherd
passed his life so miserably that, at times, he would have
counted as gain the evil of losing her, if only he might
not feel the pain which it caused him not to win her. And
so one day, having set himself to consider his varied thoughts,
in the midst of a delightful meadow, invited by the solitude
and by the murmur of a delightful streamlet that ran through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
the plain, he took from his wallet a polished rebeck (singing
to the sound of which he was wont to communicate his
plaints to Heaven), and with a voice of exceeding beauty
sang the following verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">

<p class="p01">The enamoured Elicio would not so soon have ended his
agreeable song, had there not sounded on his right hand the
voice of Erastro, who with his herd of goats was coming towards
the place where he was. Erastro was a rustic herdsman; yet
his rustic lot, out in the woods, did not so far prevail with
him as to forbid that Gentle Love should take entire possession
of his manly breast, making him love more than his life the
beauteous Galatea, to whom he did declare his plaints whenever
occasion presented itself to him. And though rustic, he was,
like a true lover, so discreet in things of love, that whenever he
discoursed thereon, it seemed that Love himself revealed them
to him, and by his tongue uttered them; yet withal (although
they were heard by Galatea), they were held of such account
as things of jest are held. To Elicio the rivalry of Erastro did
not give pain, for he understood from the mind of Galatea that
it inclined her to loftier things&mdash;rather did he have pity and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
envy for Erastro: pity in seeing that he did indeed love, and
that in a quarter where it was impossible to gather the fruit of
his desires; envy in that it seemed to him that perhaps his
understanding was not such as to give room for his soul to
feel the flouts or favours of Galatea in such a way that either
the latter should overwhelm him, or the former drive him mad.
Erastro came accompanied by his mastiffs, the faithful guardians
of the simple sheep, which under their protection were safe from
the carnivorous teeth of the hungry wolves; he made sport with
them, and called them by their names, giving to each the title that
its disposition and spirit deserved. One he would call Lion,
another Hawk, one Sturdy and another Spot; and they, as if they
were endowed with understanding, came up to him and, by the
movement of their heads, expressed the pleasure which they felt
at <em>his</em> pleasure. In such wise came Erastro to where he was
amiably received by Elicio, and even asked, allowing that he
had not determined to spend the warm season of the sultry
noon-tide in any other place, since that place in which they
were was so fitted for it, whether it would be irksome to him
to spend it in his company.</p>

<p>'With no one,' replied Erastro, 'could I pass it better than
with you, Elicio, unless indeed it were with her who is as
stubborn to my entreaties as she has proved herself a very oak
to your unending plaints.'</p>

<p>Straightway the twain sat them down on the close-cropped
grass, allowing the herd to wander at will, blunting, with teeth
that chew the cud, the tender little shoots of the grassy plain.
And as Erastro by many plain tokens knew perfectly well that
Elicio loved Galatea, and that the merit of Elicio was of greater
carat than his own, in token that he recognised this truth, in
the midst of his converse, among other discourses addressed to
him the following:</p>

<p>'I know not, gay and enamoured Elicio, if the love I have for
Galatea has been the cause of giving you pain, and if it has, you
must pardon me, for I never thought to offend you, nor of
Galatea did I seek aught save to serve her. May evil madness
or cruel rot consume and destroy my frisky kids and my tender
lambkins! when they leave the teats of their dear mothers, may
they not find in the green meadow aught to sustain them save
bitter colocynth and poisonous oleander, if I have not striven a
thousand times to put her from my memory, and if I have not
gone as many times more to the leeches and priests of the place,
that they might give me a cure for the anguish I suffer on her
account! Some of them bid me take all kinds of love-potions,
others tell me to commend myself to God, who cures everything,
or that it is all madness. Suffer me, good Elicio, to love
her, for you can be sure that if you, with your talents and
admirable graces and discourses, do not soften her, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
scarce be able, with my simple ways, to move her to pity.
This favour I beg of you, by what I am indebted to your
deserving: for, even if you do not grant it me, it would be as
impossible to cease loving her, as to cause these waters to cease
from giving moisture, or the sun with his combed tresses from
giving us light.'</p>

<p>Elicio could not refrain from laughing at Erastro's discourse,
and at the courtesy with which he begged of him permission to
love Galatea; and thus he replied to him: 'It does not pain
me indeed, Erastro, that you love Galatea; it pains me much to
know from her disposition, that your truthful discourses and
sincere words will be of little avail with her. May God give you
as fair success in your desires as the sincerity of your thoughts
deserve! and henceforward cease not on my account to love
Galatea; for I am not of so mean a disposition that, if fortune
fail me, I rejoice that others should not attain her. But I pray
you, by what you owe to the good-will I show you, that you
should not deny me your converse and friendship, since of mine
you can be as sure as I have declared to you. Let our herds go
united, since our thoughts go in unison. You to the sound of
your pipe will declare the pleasure or the pain which Galatea's
joyous or sorrowful countenance shall cause you, I to the sound
of my rebeck, in the silence of the stilly night, or in the heat of
the glowing noon-tide, in the cool shade of the green trees by
which this bank of ours is made so fair, will help you to carry
the heavy load of your trouble, proclaiming mine to Heaven.
And in token of our good intent and true friendship, while the
shadows of these trees grow longer, and the sun is declining
towards the west, let us tune our instruments and make a
beginning of the practice which henceforth we are to follow.'</p>

<p>Erastro did not need asking, but with signs of supreme content
at seeing himself in such friendship with Elicio, drew forth
his pipe, and Elicio his rebeck: and, one beginning, and the
other replying, they sang what follows:</p>

<div class="verse ileft2">Be placed by fate, or chance, or what you will,</div>
<div class="verse">To pluck it down 'twere foolishness to try</div>

<div class="verse">Than death for such a noble cause as this.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">Erastro was already setting himself to follow on in his song
when they perceived, by a thickly wooded hillock which was at
their back, no slight clamour and sound; and, both rising to
their feet to see what it was, they saw a shepherd descending
from the mountain, running at the greatest speed in the world,
with a naked knife in his hand, and the hue of his countenance
changed, and, coming after him, another shepherd swift of foot,
who in a few strides overtook the first, and seizing him by the
collar of his skin-coat, raised his arm in the air as high as he
could, and a sharp dagger which he carried unsheathed, and
buried it twice in his body, saying:</p>

<p>'Receive, oh ill-starred Leonida, the life of this traitor, which
I offer up in vengeance of your death.'</p>

<p>This happened with such rapidity that Elicio and Erastro had
not the opportunity to stop him; for they came up at the time
when the stricken shepherd was already giving out his last
breath, struggling to utter these few ill-formed words:</p>

<p>'Would that you had allowed me, Lisandro, to satisfy Heaven
with a longer repentance for the wrong I did you, and had then
taken from me the life which, for the reason I have said, now
departs from this flesh ill-content.'</p>

<p>And without being able to say more he closed his eyes in
everlasting night. By these words Elicio and Erastro fancied
that for no small cause had the other shepherd inflicted on
him so cruel and violent a death. And the better to inform
themselves of the whole occurrence, they would fain have
inquired of the murderous shepherd; but he, with retreating
step, leaving the shepherd dead and the two wondering,
turned to go back into the hillock beyond. And when Elicio
desired to follow him, and to learn from him what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
wished, they saw him come again out of the wood, and, being
a good space distant from them, in a loud voice he said to them:</p>

<p>'Pardon me, gentle shepherds, if I have not been gentle in
having wrought in your presence that which you have seen, for
the just and mortal rage which I had conceived against that
traitor did not permit a more moderate course on my part.
What I counsel you is, that, if you would not anger the Deity that
dwells in high Heaven, you should not offer the last rites and
accustomed prayers for the traitorous soul of that body which you
have before you, nor give it burial, if here in your country it is
not the custom to give it to traitors.'</p>

<p>And, saying this, he turned with all speed to go into the
forest, with so much haste as to take away from Elicio the
hope of overtaking him, even though he followed him. And so
the twain with tender hearts turned to perform the pious
office, and to give burial, as best they could, to the wretched
body, which had so suddenly ended the course of its short days.
Erastro went to his hut which was not far away, and, bringing
sufficient implements, made a grave at the very spot where the
body was; and, bidding it the last farewell, they placed it therein.
Not without compassion for his hapless lot they returned to their
herds, and, collecting them again with some haste (for the sun
was already entering with all speed by the gates of the west),
betook themselves to their accustomed shelters, where neither
the comfort they felt therein, nor the little that his cares
allowed him, could keep Elicio from wondering what causes
had moved the two shepherds to come to so desperate a pass;
and already he regretted that he had not followed the murderous
shepherd, and learnt from him, if possible, what he wished.
With this thought, and with the many that his love caused
in him, after leaving his herd in a place of safety, he went out
from his hut, as was his wont at other times, and by the light of
the beauteous Diana, who showed herself resplendent in the sky,
he entered the denseness of a dense wood beyond, seeking some
solitary spot where, in the silence of the night, with greater peace
he might give rein to his amorous fancies: for it is an assured
fact that, to sad, fanciful hearts, there is no greater joy than
solitude, the awakener of sad or happy memories. And thus
going little by little, enjoying a gentle breeze which blew against
his face, full of most delicate scents, which from the scented
flowers wherewith the green earth was heaped it gently stole,
as it passed through them wrapped in the delicate air, he heard
a voice as of one who grievously complained, and checking for a
while his breath within him, so that the sound might not
hinder him from hearing what it was, he perceived that from
some thickset bramble bushes, a little way off, the mournful
voice proceeded, and though interrupted by endless sighs, he
understood that it uttered these sad words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>'Cowardly and craven arm, mortal enemy of that which you
owe to yourself, look, naught now remains on which to take
vengeance, save yourself! What does it profit you to prolong
the life I hold in so great abhorrence? If you think that our ill
is of those that time is wont to heal, you live deceived, for there
is nothing more remote from cure than our misfortune: seeing
that she who might have made mine pleasant, had a life so short
that, in the green years of her joyous youth, she offered it to the
blood-thirsty knife, that it might take it from her, through
the treason of the wicked Carino. He to-day, by losing his
own, will have in part appeased that blessed soul of Leonida, if,
in the heavenly region where she dwells, she can cherish desire
for any vengeance. Ah, Carino, Carino! I beseech the high
Heavens, if by them just prayers are heard, not to heed the plea,
if any you offer, for the treachery you have done me, and to
suffer that your body may lack burial, even as your soul lacked
mercy. And you, fair and hapless Leonida, receive, in token of
the love I bore you in life, the tears I shed at your death; and
put it not down to lack of feeling that I do not end my life, with
all I feel at your death: for a grief that should end so soon
would be a scant return for what I ought and wish to feel. You
will see, if you take account of things here, how this wretched
body will one day be consumed by grief, little by little, for
its greater grief and suffering: even as powder, moist and
kindled, which, without making a noise, or raising a flame on
high, is consumed in itself, without leaving of itself aught save
the traces of consumed ashes. It grieves me as much as it
can grieve me, oh soul of my soul, seeing that I could not
enjoy you in life, that in death I cannot perform for you
the last rites and honours which befitted your goodness
and virtue; but I promise to you, and swear, for the short
time&mdash;and it will be very short&mdash;that this impassioned soul
of mine shall rule the heavy burden of this wretched body,
and my weary voice have breath to form it, not to treat
aught else in my sad and bitter songs save your praises and
deserts.'</p>

<p>At this point the voice ceased, from the sound of which Elicio
clearly perceived that it was the murderous shepherd; whereat
he was much rejoiced, because it seemed to him that he was in a
position to learn from him what he desired. And, wishing to
approach more closely, he needs must stop again, for it seemed
to him that the shepherd was tuning a rebeck, and he wished
first to hear if he should say anything to its sound. And he did
not wait long before he heard him, with gentle and tuneful voice,
singing after this wise:</p>

<p class="p01">Here ceased the voice, but not the sighs of the hapless swain
who had sung, and both served to increase in Elicio the desire
to know who he was. And bursting through the thorny
brambles so as to reach more quickly the spot whence the voice
proceeded, he came to a little meadow which, in the fashion of
a theatre, was girt all round with very dense and tangled
shrubs; and there he saw a shepherd who was standing in an
attitude of great vigour, with his right foot advanced and his
left behind, his right arm raised in the manner of one hoping to
make a mighty throw. And such was the truth, for at the noise
which Elicio had made in bursting through the bushes, he,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
thinking it was some wild beast (against which the woodland
shepherds were forced to defend themselves), had placed himself
in a position to hurl at him a weighty stone he was holding
in his hand. Elicio, perceiving his intent by his posture, before
he could accomplish it, said to him: 'Calm your bosom, hapless
shepherd, for he who comes hither, brings a bosom ready for all
you might ask of it; desire to learn your fortune has made him
break in upon your tears, and disturb the solace which might
attend upon you in solitude.'</p>

<p>With these gentle and courteous words of Elicio the shepherd
was calmed, and with no less gentleness replied to him, saying:
'I gratefully acknowledge your kind offer, whoever you be,
courteous shepherd; but, as for fortune, if you desire to learn
mine who never had any, you will scarce be able to have your
wish.' 'You speak true,' answered Elicio, 'since from the words
and plaints I this night have heard from you, you clearly show
the little or none that you have. But you will no less satisfy my
desire by telling me your troubles than by making known to me
your joys. May fortune give you these in what you desire, so
that you do not deny me what I beg of you, if indeed your not
knowing me do not prevent it; although I would have you
know, so as to reassure and move you, that I have not a soul so
happy as not to feel as much as it should the miseries you
would recount to me. This I tell you, for I know that nothing
is more wasted, nay thrown away, than for an unhappy man to
recount his woes to one whose heart is brimful with joys.' 'Your
kindly words,' answered the shepherd, 'compel me to satisfy
you in what you ask me, not only that you may not fancy that
from a mean and craven soul spring the complaints and
lamentations you say you have heard from me, but also that
you may realise that the feeling I show is but small as compared
with the cause I have for showing it.'</p>

<p>Elicio thanked him heartily, and after some more courteous
words had passed between the two, Elicio giving proof that he
was a true friend of the woodland shepherd, the latter, recognising
that they were not feigned promises, granted in the end
what Elicio asked. The twain sate them down on the green
grass, covered with the splendour of the fair Diana, who could
that night rival her brother in brightness, and the woodland
shepherd, with tokens of a tender grief, began to speak in this
wise:</p>

<p>'On the banks of the Betis, a stream exceeding rich in waters,
which enriches great Vandalia, was born Lisandro (for that is
my luckless name), and of parents so noble that I would to
Almighty God I had been begotten in a lowlier station; for
ofttimes nobility of lineage lends wings and strength to the soul
to raise the eyes to where a humble lot would never dare to raise
them, and from such boldness calamities are often wont to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
spring such as you shall hear from me, if with attention you will
listen to me. In my village was also born a shepherdess, whose
name was Leonida, the sum of all the beauty which, as I fancy,
could be found in a great part of the world,&mdash;born of parents no
less noble and wealthy than her beauty and virtue deserved.
Whence it came to pass that, the parents of both being among
the chief people of the place, and the rule and government of
the village being vested in them, envy, the deadly enemy of a
peaceful life, brought about strife and mortal discord between
them over some differences concerning the administration of the
village, in such a manner that the village was divided into two
factions; the one followed that of my parents, the other that of
Leonida's, with so deep-rooted a hatred and malice that no
human effort has been able to bring about peace between them.
Fate then decreed, as though to shut out every prospect of
friendship, that I should fall in love with the fair Leonida,
daughter of Parmindro, the head of the opposite faction; and
my love was, indeed, so great that, though I strove in countless
ways to put it from my heart, they all ended in my remaining
yet more vanquished and enslaved. Before me rose a mountain
of difficulties, which hindered me from gaining the end of my
desire, such as Leonida's great worth, the inveterate enmity of
our parents, the few or no occasions which presented themselves
to me for disclosing my thoughts to her: and yet, whenever
I turned the eyes of fancy towards the rare beauty of Leonida,
every difficulty was made smooth, so that it seemed to me a
little thing to break through sharp points of adamant, that
I might reach the goal of my loving and honourable thoughts.
Having then for many days battled with myself, to see if I could
turn my soul from a design so arduous, and seeing that it was
impossible, I set all my skill on considering how I might give
Leonida to understand the secret love in my breast. And even
as, in any matter, the beginnings are always difficult, so in those
that relate to love they are for the most exceedingly difficult,
until Love himself, when he wishes to show himself favourable,
opens the gates of the remedy, where they seem most closely
barred. Thus it appeared in my case, for my thought being
guided by his, I came to fancy that no better means presented
themselves to my desire than to make friends with the parents
of Silvia, a shepherdess who was a bosom friend of Leonida,
and often they visited each other at their houses, in company
with their parents. Silvia had a kinsman called Carino, a very
close companion of Crisalvo, fair Leonida's brother, whose
boldness and harshness of manner had gained him the nickname
of cruel, and so, by all those who knew him, he was
generally called cruel Crisalvo; and in the same way they
called Carino, Silvia's kinsman and Crisalvo's companion, the
cunning Carino, from his being officious and sharp-witted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
With him and with Silvia (for it seemed to serve my purpose)
by means of many presents and gifts I forged a friendship, to
outward seeming: at least on Silvia's side it was stronger than
I desired, for the presents and favours, which with pure heart she
bestowed on me, constrained by my unceasing services, were
by my fortune taken as instruments to place me in the misery
where now I see myself. Silvia was passing fair, and adorned
with graces so many that the hardness of Crisalvo's savage
heart was moved to love her (but this I did not learn save to my
hurt); and many days later, after that from long experience
I was sure of Silvia's good-will, an opportunity offering itself one
day, in the tenderest words I could, I disclosed to her the
wound in my stricken breast, telling her that, though it was so
deep and dangerous, I did not feel it so much, only because I
thought that in her solicitude lay its cure. I informed her, too,
of the honourable goal to which my thoughts were tending,
which was to unite myself in lawful wedlock with the beauteous
Leonida; and that, since it was a cause so just and good, she
must not disdain to take it under her care. Finally, not to
weary you, love furnished me with such words to say to her,
that she, being overcome by them and more by the pain which
she, like a clever woman, recognised from the signs of my face
as dwelling in my soul, determined to take charge of my cure,
and to tell Leonida what I felt for her, promising to do for me
all that her power and skill might achieve, even though
such an undertaking was fraught with difficulties for her,
by reason of the great enmity she knew to exist between
our parents; though, on the other hand she thought
that it might put an end to their differences, if Leonida
were to marry me. Moved then by this good intention, and
softened by the tears I shed, as I have said before, she dared to
intercede on behalf of my happiness, and, discussing with
herself how she would approach Leonida, she made me write
her a letter, which she offered to give her at the moment she
thought fitting. Her counsel seemed to be for my good, and
that same day I sent her a letter, which I have always known
by heart, as having been the beginning of the happiness I felt
at the reply to it, though it would be better not to remember
happy things at a time so sad as that in which I now find myself.
Silvia received the letter, and awaited the opportunity for
placing it in Leonida's hands.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' said Elicio, interrupting Lisandro's discourse, 'it is not
right that you should fail to repeat to me the letter you sent to
Leonida, for, seeing that it was the first, and that you were so
deeply in love at that time, it must undoubtedly be eloquent.
And since you have told me that you know it by heart, and
of the pleasure you obtained from it, do not now withhold it from
me by not repeating it.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>'You say well, my friend,' replied Lisandro, 'for I was then
as deeply in love and timid as now I am unhappy and despairing;
and, on that account, it seems to me that I did not succeed in
uttering any eloquent words, though it was sufficient success that
Leonida should believe those which were in the letter. Since
you wish so much to hear them, it ran as follows:</p>


<p class="p1 center">L<small>ISANDRO TO</small> L<small>EONIDA.</small></p>

<p>"So long as I have been able (though with very great grief to
myself) to resist with my own strength the amorous flame which
for you, fair Leonida, consumes me, fearful of the exalted worth
which I recognise in you, I have never had the boldness to
discover to you the love I bear you; but now that the virtue, which
up till now has made me strong, is consumed, it has become
necessary for me to disclose the wound in my breast, and thus,
by writing to you, to make trial of the first and last remedy in
your power. What the first may be, you know, and to be the
last is in your hand, from which I hope for the pity that your
beauty promises, and my honourable desires merit. What they
are, and the goal to which they tend, you shall learn from
Silvia, who will give you this: and since she has been so bold,
being who she is, as to bring it to you, know that they are as
honourable as is due to your merit".'</p>

<p>The words of this letter did not seem bad to Elicio, and
Lisandro, continuing the story of his love, said:</p>

<p>'Many days did not pass before this letter came into the fair
hands of Leonida, by means of the kindly hands of Silvia, my
true friend. In giving it, she told her such things that she
largely assuaged the rage and emotion which Leonida had felt
at my letter, such as telling her how good it would be if through
our marriage the enmity of our parents were to cease, and that
an object so well meant should lead her not to reject my desires;
all the more as it should not be compatible with her beauty
to allow one who loved her as much as I to die, without
more consideration; adding to these other reasonings, which
Leonida recognised as just. But, so as not to show herself
vanquished in the first encounter, and won in the first advance,
she did not give to Silvia as pleasant a reply as she wished.
But still, at the intercession of Silvia, who forced her to it, she
replied with this letter which I shall now repeat to you:</p>


<p class="p1 center">L<small>EONIDA TO</small> L<small>ISANDRO.</small></p>

<p>"If I had thought, Lisandro, that your great daring had sprung
from my lack of modesty, I would have carried out on myself the
punishment that your fault deserves; but as what I know of
myself makes me sure on this point, I have come to the conclusion
that your great boldness has proceeded more from idle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
thoughts, than from thoughts of love; and though they may be
as you say, think not that you can move me to cure them, as you
did Silvia to believe them. I complain more of her for having
made me answer you, than of you who dared to write to me, for
silence had been fit answer to your folly. If you draw back
from your purpose, you will act wisely, for I would have you
know that I deem my honour of more account than your empty
thoughts."</p>

<p>This was Leonida's reply, which, together with the hopes that
Silvia gave me, though it seemed somewhat harsh, made me
count myself the happiest man on earth. Whilst these matters
were passing between us, Crisalvo did not neglect to woo Silvia
with countless messages, gifts and services; but so hard and
severe was Crisalvo's disposition that he could never move
Silvia to grant him the smallest favour. Whereat he was as
desperate and impatient as a bull when speared and vanquished.
For the sake of his love he had formed a friendship with the
cunning Carino, Silvia's kinsman, though these two had first
been mortal enemies, for in a wrestling-bout, which on a great
feast-day the deftest swains of the place held before all the
village, Carino was vanquished by Crisalvo, and mauled: so
that he conceived in his heart undying hatred for Crisalvo, and
no less was the hatred he felt against another person, a brother
of mine, for having thwarted him in a love-affair, in which my
brother carried off the fruit Carino hoped for. This rancour
and ill-will Carino kept secret till time disclosed to him the
opportunity when he might avenge himself on both at once, in
the cruellest way imaginable. I kept friends with him, so that
admission to Silvia's house might not be denied me; Crisalvo
adored him, so that he might further his designs with Silvia;
and his friendship was such that whenever Leonida came to
Silvia's house, Carino accompanied her: wherefore it seemed
good to Silvia to tell him, since he was my friend, of my love-affair
with Leonida, which was by this time prospering with such
ardour and good fortune, through Silvia's good offices, that we
now awaited but the time and place to cull the honourable fruit
of our pure desires. On hearing of this, Carino used me as an
instrument to commit the greatest treason in the world. For
one day (feigning to be true to Crisalvo, and giving him to
understand that he rated his friendship higher than his kinswoman's
honour), he told him that the chief reason why Silvia
did not love or favour him, was that she was in love with me;
he knew it unmistakably, and our love-affair was going on so
openly that if he had not been blinded by his amorous passion
he would by now have perceived it from a thousand signs; and
the more to assure himself of the truth he was telling him, he
bade him look to it henceforward, for he would see clearly how
Silvia without any restraint granted me exceptional favours. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
this news Crisalvo must have been quite beside himself, as
appeared from what followed therefrom. Henceforward he
employed spies to watch my dealings with Silvia; and as on
many occasions I sought to be alone with her, in order to speak
not of the love he thought, but of things concerning mine, these
were reported to Crisalvo, together with other favours prompted
by pure friendship, which Silvia showed me at every step.
Whereat Crisalvo came to so desperate a pass, that many times
he sought to kill me, though I did not think it was for such
a cause, but on account of the long-standing enmity of our
parents. But as he was Leonida's brother, I was more concerned
to guard myself than to harm him, thinking it certain that if I
married his sister our enmities would have an end. Of this he
was quite ignorant, thinking rather that, because I was his
enemy, I had sought to make love to Silvia, and not because I
was really fond of her; and this increased his anger and resentment
to such a degree that it robbed him of reason, though he
had so little that little was needed to destroy it. And this evil
thought wrought so strongly in him, that he came to loath
Silvia as much as he had loved her, merely because she favoured
me, not with the good-will he thought, but as Carino told him.
And so, in whatever circle or assembly he was, he spoke ill of
Silvia, giving her dishonourable names and epithets. But as all
knew his ugly character and Silvia's goodness, they lent little or
no belief to his words. Meanwhile Silvia had arranged with
Leonida that we two should be married, and, in order that it
might be done with more safety to ourselves, that it would be well
for Leonida, one day when she came with Carino to her house,
not to return that night to that of her parents, but to go thence
in Carino's company to a village half a league distant from ours,
where some rich kinsmen of mine lived, in whose house we
could with greater peace effect our designs. For if Leonida's
parents were not pleased at the issue, it would at least be easier,
when she was away from them, to come to terms. This resolve
having been taken, Carino was informed of it, and, displaying
the greatest spirit, offered to Silvia to escort Leonida to the other
village as she desired. The services I did to Carino for the
good-will he showed, the promises I uttered to him, the embraces
I gave him, would methinks have sufficed to extinguish in a heart
of steel any evil purpose it might cherish against me. But that
traitor of a Carino, casting behind him my words, deeds and
promises, without regarding what he owed himself, planned the
treason which now you shall hear. Having informed himself of
Leonida's wish, and seeing that it agreed with what Silvia had
told him, he planned that on the first night which from the
appearance of the day promised to be dark, Leonida's departure
should be effected, offering once more to maintain all possible
secrecy and loyalty. After making this agreement which you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
have heard, he went off to Crisalvo, as I have since learnt, and
told him that his kinswoman Silvia had gone so far in her love-affair
with me, that I had determined on a certain night to steal
her from her parents' house, and take her to another village where
my kinsmen dwelt. There an opportunity offered itself to avenge
his feelings on both, on Silvia for the small account she had
made of his services, on me for our long-standing enmity, and
for the injury I had done him in robbing him of Silvia, since she
was leaving him on my account alone. Carino knew how to
exaggerate to him, and to say what he wanted, in such a way
as, even with less effort, would have moved to any evil purpose a
heart not so cruel as his. The day being now arrived which I
thought was to be the day of my greatest bliss, after having told
Carino not what he actually did do, but what he was to do, I
went off to the other village to give orders how to receive
Leonida. And to leave her entrusted to Carino was like leaving
the innocent lamb in the power of the hungry wolves, or the
gentle dove in the claws of the fierce hawk, who tears it to
pieces. Ah, friend! when I come to this point with my imagination,
I know not how I have strength to sustain life, nor thought
to think of it, much more tongue to tell it! Ah, ill-advised
Lisandro! How did you not know Carino's duplicity? Yet,
who would not have trusted his words, since he risked so little in
proving them true by deeds! Ah, ill-starred Leonida! how
little did I know how to enjoy the favour you did me, in choosing
me for your own! Finally, to end with the tragedy of my
misfortune, you must know, discreet shepherd, that on the night
Carino was to take Leonida with him to the village where I
was expecting her, he summoned another shepherd, called
Libeo, who ought to have considered him an enemy, though
Carino concealed it beneath his wonted false dissimulation, and
asked him to accompany him that night, for he was resolved to
carry off a shepherdess, his sweetheart, to the village I have
told you, where he purposed to marry her. Libeo, a man of
spirit and a lover himself, readily offered him his company.
Leonida bade farewell to Silvia with close embraces and loving
tears, an omen, as it were, that it was to be the last farewell.
The hapless maid must needs have thought then of the treason
she was committing against her parents; not of that Carino
was planning against her,&mdash;and how bad a return she was
making for the good opinion that was held about her in the
village. But, passing over all these thoughts, constrained by
the loving thought that vanquished her, she entrusted herself to
the care of Carino, who was to conduct her to where I awaited
her. How often do I call to mind when I reach this point,
what I dreamed the day I would have counted fortunate, had the
number of my days ended thereon! I remember that, leaving
the village a little while before the sun withdrew his rays from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
our horizon, I sate me down at the foot of a tall ash tree on the
very road by which Leonida was to come, waiting till night
should close in a little more to further my purpose and to
receive her, and without knowing how or wishing it, I fell asleep.
Scarce had I yielded my eyes to slumber when, methought, the
tree against which I leaned, bending before the fury of a fierce
wind that was blowing, tearing its deep roots out of the earth,
fell upon my body, and attempting to get away from the heavy
weight, I rolled from side to side. While in this plight
methought I saw a white hind beside me, which I earnestly
implored to lift, as well as it could, the heavy burden from my
shoulders, and when moved with compassion, it was about to do
it, at the same moment a fierce lion sprang from the thicket, and
seizing it in his sharp claws, marched off with it through the
forest. After I had escaped with great toil from the heavy
burden, I went to look for it in the mountain, and found it torn
and wounded in a thousand places. Whereat I felt so much
grief that my soul was wrung from me merely by reason of the
pity it had shown at my plight: and thus I began to weep in
my dreams, so that the tears themselves awoke me, and finding
my cheeks bathed with sorrow I was beside myself, pondering
on what I had dreamed; but in the joy I hoped to have in
seeing my Leonida, I failed to see then that fortune was showing
me in dreams what was to happen in a short time to me awake.
At the moment when I awoke night had just closed in with such
darkness, with such terrible thunder and lightning as furthered
the perpetration of the cruel deed which that night was perpetrated.
As Carino left Silvia's house with Leonida, he
entrusted her to Libeo, telling him to go with her by the road
to the village I have mentioned, and though Leonida was perturbed
at seeing Libeo, Carino assured her that Libeo was no
less a friend of mine than he was, and that in security she could
go with him slowly whilst he went forward to give me tidings
of her approach. The guileless maid, being after all in love,
believed the words of the treacherous Carino, and with less
mistrust than was fitting, guided by the courteous Libeo,
advanced her timid steps, which were to be the last of her life,
thinking they led her to the height of her bliss. Carino went
on before the two, as I have already told you, and gave information
of what was happening to Crisalvo, who with four of his
kinsmen was in ambush on the very road by which they were
to pass, this being wholly shut in by forest on either side. He
told them how Silvia was coming and I was the only one with
her, and that they should rejoice at the good opportunity fate
put in their hands to avenge the wrong we two had done him,
and that he should be the first to prove the edge of his knife on
Silvia, though she was a kinswoman of his. Immediately the
five cruel butchers prepared to stain themselves in the innocent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
blood of the pair who came along the road all unsuspicious of
such treason; when they reached the place where the ambush
was, at once the traitorous murderers were on them, and
surrounded them. Crisalvo came up to Leonida, thinking she
was Silvia, and with insulting and excited words, in the hellish
rage which mastered him, left her stretched on the ground with
six mortal wounds, whilst Libeo weltered on the earth with
countless stabs dealt by the other four, who thought they were
inflicting them on me. When Carino saw how well his
traitorous intent had turned out, without awaiting words, he
went away, and the five traitors, fully satisfied as if they had
done some notable exploit, returned to their village. Crisalvo
went to Silvia's house himself to give her parents the news
of what he had done, so as to increase their grief and pain,
telling them to go and bury their daughter Silvia, whose life he
had taken because she had set more store on the cold esteem of
Lisandro his enemy, than on the unremitting attentions shown
by him. Silvia, who heard what Crisalvo was saying,&mdash;her soul
telling her what had happened, told him that she was alive, and
free too from all that he had accused her of; and that he should
be sure he had not killed one whose death would grieve him
more than the loss of his own life. And with this she told him
that his sister Leonida had that night left her house in unwonted
apparel. Crisalvo was amazed to see Silvia alive, thinking for
sure that he had left her dead, and being suddenly seized with
great fear, immediately hastened to his house, and not finding
his sister there, returned alone in the greatest consternation and
frenzy to see who it was he had killed, since Silvia was alive.
Whilst all this was going on, I was awaiting Carino and Leonida
with strange anxiety; and as it seemed to me that by this time
they were later than they should be, I wished to go and meet
them, or learn if by any accident they had been detained that
night. I had not gone far along the road when I heard a piteous
voice saying: "Oh sovereign Maker of Heaven, withhold the
hand of thy justice and open that of thy mercy in order to show
mercy to this soul, which soon shall give account to thee of the
offences it has committed against thee! Ah Lisandro, Lisandro!
surely Carino's friendship will yet cost you your life, since it cannot
be that grief for my having lost mine for your sake will put an end
to it! Ah, cruel brother, can it be that without hearing my
excuses you desired to inflict on me so soon the punishment of my
error?" When I heard these words, I at once recognised from
the voice and from them that it was Leonida who uttered them,
and&mdash;an augury of my misfortune&mdash;with feelings in a turmoil, I
set to groping where Leonida was weltering in her own blood; and,
having at once recognised her, I let myself fall on her wounded
body, and with the greatest grief possible, said to her: "What
woe is this, my joy, my soul? what cruel hand was it that did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
respect so much beauty?" At these words I was recognised by
Leonida; and raising her weary arms with much effort, she
threw them round my neck, and, pressing with all her strength,
she joined her mouth to mine, and, with weak and broken
utterance, spoke but these words to me: "My brother has killed
me, Carino ... betrayed, Libeo is without life, and may God
give you yours, Lisandro mine, for long and happy years, and
may he grant that I enjoy in another life the peace denied me
here;" and, joining her mouth closer to mine, she pressed
her lips together to give me her first and last kiss; and, as she
opened them, her soul went from her, and she lay dead in my
arms. When I perceived it, I abandoned myself to grief over
her body, and remained senseless; and if, instead of being alive,
I had been dead, whoever saw us in that plight had called to
mind the hapless plight of Pyramus and Thisbe. But on coming
to myself, I had opened my mouth to fill the air with cries and
sobs, when I perceived someone coming with hurried steps to
where I was; and, when he was near, though the night was dark,
the eyes of my soul gave me assurance that he who came there
was Crisalvo, as was the truth. He was coming back to convince
himself whether perchance it was his sister Leonida he had
killed. When I recognised him, before he could guard himself
against me, I came upon him like a raging lion; and, giving him
two blows, I brought him to the ground. Before he ceased to
breathe, I dragged him to where Leonida was, and, placing in
her dead hand the dagger her brother wore&mdash;the same with
which she had been killed&mdash;I guided it and plunged it thrice
through his heart. And mine being somewhat consoled by
Crisalvo's death, without further delay I took upon my shoulders
Leonida's body, and bore it to the village where my kinsmen
lived. Telling them what had happened, I asked them to give
it honourable burial, and immediately determined to take on
Carino the same vengeance as on Crisalvo; but, since he has
kept away from our village, it has been delayed until to-day,
when I found him on the skirts of this wood, after going about in
search of him for six months. Now he has come to the end his
treason deserved; and none now is left on whom to wreak
vengeance, unless it be the life I endure so much against my
will. This, shepherd, is the cause whence proceed the laments
you have heard from me. If it seems to you sufficient to
cause yet a deeper grief, I leave to your good judgment to
determine!'</p>

<p>Therewith he ended his discourse, and set to weeping so
copiously that Elicio could not refrain from keeping him company
therein; but after they had for a long while eased with
gentle sighs, the one the pain he suffered, the other the
compassion he felt thereat, Elicio began to console Lisandro
with the best arguments he knew, though his misfortune was as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
far beyond consolation as he had seen from its issue. Amongst
other things he said to him, the one which gave Lisandro most
solace was to tell him that in misfortunes beyond remedy, the
best remedy was to hope for none; and, since one might believe
from Leonida's purity and noble disposition, according to his
account, that she was enjoying a life of bliss, he should rather
rejoice at the happiness she had gained, than grieve for that
which she had lost. Whereto Lisandro replied:</p>

<p>'I know full well, my friend, that your arguments have power to
make me believe they are true; but not that they have&mdash;nor will
all the arguments in the world have&mdash;power to give me any
consolation. With Leonida's death began my evil fortune,
which will end when I behold her again; and since this cannot
be without I die, the man who should help me to attain death
will I count the greatest friend of my life!'</p>

<p>Elicio did not wish to give him more sorrow with his words of
solace, since he did not regard them as such; only he asked him
to come with him to his hut, where he might stay as long as it
pleased him, offering him his friendship in all wherein he might be
able to serve him. Lisandro thanked him as heartily as possible;
and though he was unwilling to consent to go with Elicio, yet
he had to do so, constrained by his repeated asking. And so
the two arose, and came to Elicio's cabin, where they rested for
the little that remained of the night. Now when the white dawn
was leaving the couch of her jealous husband, and beginning to
give signs of the coming day, Erastro arose and began to put
in order Elicio's herd and his own to lead them to the accustomed
pasture. Elicio invited Lisandro to come with him; and
so, when the three shepherds came with their gentle flock of
sheep through a ravine below, on ascending an incline, they
heard the sound of a gentle pipe, which was straightway
recognized by the two enamoured swains, Elicio and Erastro,
for it was Galatea who was playing it. And it was not long
before some sheep began to show themselves over the crest
of the hill, and immediately behind them Galatea, whose beauty
was such that it were better to leave it to speak for itself,
since words fail to enhance it. She came dressed like a girl
of the mountains, with her long hair free to the wind, whereof
the sun himself appeared to be envious, for, smiting it with
his rays, he sought to rob it of lustre if he could; but that
which came from the glimmer of it seemed another new sun.
Erastro was beside himself looking at her, and Elicio could not
keep his eyes from gazing at her. When Galatea saw the flock
of Elicio and Erastro join hers, she showed that she did not wish
that day to keep them company, and called to the pet lamb of
her flock, which the rest followed, and directed it to another
spot, different from that for which the shepherds were making.
Elicio, seeing what Galatea was doing, and being unable to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
endure such open contempt, came to where the shepherdess was
and said to her:</p>

<p>'Permit your flock, fair Galatea, to come with ours, and, if you
do not like our company, choose that which will please you
better, for your sheep will not, through your absence, lack good
pasturage, since I, who was born to serve you, will take more
care of them than of my own. Do not seek to disdain me so
openly, for the pure affection I cherish towards you does not
deserve it. According to the way you were taking, you were
making for the spring of slates, but, now you have seen me, you
wish to change your road; and, if this is as I think, tell me
where you wish, to-day and always, to graze your herd, for I
swear to you never to take mine there.'</p>

<p>'I assure you, Elicio,' replied Galatea, 'that it was not to shun
your company or that of Erastro that I have changed the way
you think I was taking, for my intention is to spend the noon-tide
of to-day by the stream of palms, in the company of my
friend Florisa, who is awaiting me there, for as early as
yesterday we two agreed to graze our flocks there to-day. As
I came along, heedlessly playing my pipe, the pet lamb took
the road of slates, as more accustomed for it. For the affection
you bear me and the offers you make me I thank you, and
count it no small thing that I have justified myself against
your suspicion.'</p>

<p>'Ah, Galatea!' replied Elicio, 'how well you invent what
seems good to you, though you have so little need to use stratagem
with me, for after all I do not seek to wish more than you
wish! Now, whether you go to the stream of palms, to the
wood of council, or to the spring of slates, be assured that you
cannot go alone, for my soul accompanies you always; and,
if you do not see it, it is because you do not wish to see it, so
that you may not be obliged to heal it.'</p>

<p>'Until now,' said Galatea, 'I have yet to see my first soul, and
so I am not to blame if I have healed none.'</p>

<p>'I do not know how you can say that, fair Galatea,' replied
Elicio, 'since you see them to wound them, and not to heal them.'</p>

<p>'You accuse me falsely,' replied Galatea, 'in saying that I
have wounded anyone without arms, seeing that these are not
granted to women.'</p>

<p>'Ah, discreet Galatea,' said Elicio, 'how you jest at what you
perceive of my soul, which you have invisibly wounded, and with
no other arms than those of your beauty! I do not so much
complain of the wrong you have done me, as that you hold it in
little account.'</p>

<p>'I would hold myself in less account, if I held it in more,'
replied Galatea.</p>

<p>At this moment Erastro came up, and, seeing that Galatea was
going off and leaving them, said to her:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>'Where are you going, whom do you flee, fair Galatea? If
you part from us who adore you, who shall hope for your company?
Ah fair foe! how heedlessly you go your way, triumphing
over our affections! May Heaven destroy the warm affection I
bear you, if I do not long to see you in love with some one who
may value your plaints in the same degree as you value mine!
Do you laugh at what I say, Galatea? Then I weep at what you
do.'</p>

<p>Galatea could not answer Erastro, for she was going away,
guiding her flock towards the stream of palms; and bowing her
head from afar in token of farewell, she left them. When she
saw herself alone, whilst she was making for the spot where her
friend Florisa thought she would be, with the exquisite voice
Heaven had pleased to give her, she went along singing this
sonnet:</p>


<div class="p01">G<small>ALATEA.</small></div>
<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p>Away with noose and frost, with dart and fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em; ">Whereby to strangle, freeze, or wound or burn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em; ">Love doth essay! 'Tis vain: my soul doth yearn</span><br />
For no such knot, nor doth such flame desire.<br />
Let each bind, freeze, kill, press, consume in ire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em; ">'Gainst any other will its anger turn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em; ">But mine shall snow or net or arrow spurn,</span><br />
To hold me in its heat let none aspire.<br />
My chaste intent will chill the burning flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em; ">The knot I shall break through by force or art,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em; ">My glowing zeal will melt away the snows,</span><br />
The arrow shall fall blunted by my shame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em; ">And thus nor noose nor fire, nor frost nor dart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em; ">Shall make me fear, safe in secure repose.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">With juster cause might beasts stand still, trees move and
stones unite on hearing Galatea's gentle song and sweet harmony
than when to Orpheus' lute, Apollo's lyre, or Amphion's music
the walls of Troy and Thebes of their own accord set themselves
in the ground without any craftsman laying hand thereon, and
the sisters, dark dwellers in deepest chaos, grew gentle at the
exquisite voice of the unheeding lover. Galatea finished her
song, and at the moment came to where Florisa was, by whom
she was received with joyous mien, as being her true friend, and
she to whom Galatea was wont to tell her thoughts. After the
two had allowed their flocks to go at their will to graze on
the green grass, they determined, invited by the clearness of the
water of a stream flowing by, to wash their beauteous faces; for,
to enhance their beauty, they had no need of the vain and irksome
arts whereby those ladies in great cities who think themselves
most beautiful, torture theirs. They remained as beautiful after
washing as before, save that, through having rubbed their faces
with their hands, their cheeks remained aflame and blushing-red,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
so that an indescribable beauty made them yet more fair, and
especially Galatea. In her were seen united the three Graces
whom the Greeks of old depicted naked to show (amongst other
purposes) that they were mistresses of beauty. Straightway they
began to gather divers flowers from the green meadow with
intent to make each a garland wherewith to bind up the disordered
tresses that flowed freely over their shoulders. In this
task the two beauteous shepherdesses were engaged when of a
sudden they saw, by the stream below, a shepherdess coming of
gentle grace and bearing, whereat they wondered not a little, for
it seemed to them that she was not a shepherdess of their village
nor of the others near by: wherefore they looked at her with
more attention and saw that she was coming gradually to where
they were; and though they were quite near, she came so
absorbed and lost in thought that she never saw them until they
chose to show themselves. From time to time she stopped, and
raising her eyes to Heaven, uttered sighs so piteous that they
seemed to be torn from her innermost soul; at the same time she
wrung her white hands, and tears like liquid pearls she let fall
down her cheeks. From the extremes of grief the shepherdess
displayed Galatea and Florisa perceived that her soul was filled
with some inward grief, and to see on what her feelings were set,
both hid themselves amongst some close-grown myrtles, and
thence watched with curious gaze what the shepherdess was
doing. She came to the brink of the stream, and with steadfast
gaze stopped to watch the water running by; and letting
herself fall on its bank, as one wearied, she hollowed one
of her fair hands, and therein took up of the clear water,
wherewith she bathed her moist eyes, saying with voice low
and enfeebled:</p>

<p>'Ah water clear and cool, how little avails your coldness to
temper the fire I feel in my soul! Vain will it be to hope from
you&mdash;or indeed from all the waters the mighty ocean holds&mdash;the
remedy I need; for if all were applied to the glowing passion
that consumes me, you would produce the same effect as do a
few drops on the glowing forge which but increase the flame the
more. Ah, sad eyes, cause of my ruin! to how lofty a height
did I raise you for so great a fall! Ah fortune, enemy of my
repose! with what haste didst thou hurl me from the pinnacle
of my joy to the abyss of misery wherein I am! Ah cruel sister!
how came it that Artidoro's meek and loving presence did not
appease the anger of your breast devoid of love? What words
could he say to you that you should give him so harsh and cruel
a reply? It seems clear, sister, that you did not esteem him as
much as I; for, if it were so, you would in truth have shown as
much meekness as he obedience to you.'</p>

<p>All that the shepherdess said she mingled with such tears,
that no heart could listen to her and not be moved to com<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>passion;
and after she had calmed her sorrowing breast for a
while, to the sound of the water gently flowing by, she sang with
sweet and dainty voice this gloss, adapting to her purpose an
ancient verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">

<p><em>Hope hath fled and will not stay<br />

</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">Soon the shepherdess ended her song, but not the tears which
made it more sad. Moved to compassion thereby, Galatea and
Florisa came out from where they lay concealed, and with loving
and courteous words greeted the sad shepherdess, saying to her
among other things:</p>


<p>'So may Heaven, fair shepherdess, show itself favourable to
what you would ask of it, and so may you obtain from it what
you desire, if you tell us (allowing that it be not displeasing to
you), what fortune or what destiny has brought you to this region,
for, according to the experience we have of it, we have never
seen you on these banks. Now that we have heard what you
have just sung, gathering from it that your heart has not the
calm it needs, and by reason of the tears you have shed, of
which your lovely eyes gave witness, in the name of fair courtesy
we are bound to give you all the solace in our power; and if
your evil be of those that do not permit of consolation you will
at least perceive in us a good will to serve you.'</p>

<p>'I know not, fair maidens,' replied the strange shepherdess,
'how I shall be able to repay you save by silence for the courteous
offers you make me, unless by saying no more about it, and
being grateful for it, and valuing them as much as they deserve
it, and by not withholding from you what you wish to learn from
me, although it would be better for me to pass by in silence the
circumstances of my misfortunes, than to tell them and give you
cause to count me immodest.'</p>

<p>'Your countenance and the gentle bearing that Heaven has
given you,' replied Galatea, 'do not betoken an intellect so
coarse as to make you do a thing in telling which afterwards
you must needs lose reputation; and since your appearance
and words have in so short a time made this impression
on us, that we already count you discreet, prove to us, by
telling us your life, whether your misfortune comes up to
your discretion.'</p>

<p>'As far as I believe,' replied the shepherdess, 'both are on a
level, unless, indeed, fate has given me more judgment, the more
to feel the griefs that present themselves; but I am quite sure
that my woes exceed my discretion, in the same degree as
all my craft is overcome by them, since I have none wherewith
to cure them. And that experience may set you right, if
you wish to hear me, fair maidens, I will tell you, in as few words
as possible, how, from the great understanding you judge I
possess, has sprung the woe which surpasses it.'</p>

<p>'With nothing will you better satisfy our desires, discreet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
maiden,' replied Florisa, 'than with telling us what we have
asked you.'</p>

<p>'Let us retire, then,' said the shepherdess, 'from this spot,
and seek another, where, without being seen or disturbed, I may
be able to tell you what it grieves me to have promised you, for
I foresee that it will not cost more to lose the good opinion I
have gained with you, than to reveal my thoughts to you, however
late, if perhaps yours have not been touched by the
affliction I am suffering.'</p>

<p>Desirous that the shepherdess should fulfil her promise,
straightway the three arose, and betook themselves to a secret
and retired place, known already to Galatea and Florisa, where,
beneath the pleasant shade of some leafy myrtles, without being
seen by anybody, all three could be seated. Forthwith, with
exquisite grace and charm, the strange shepherdess began to
speak in this wise:</p>

<p>'On the banks of the famous Henares, which ever yields fresh
and pleasant tribute to your golden Tagus, most beauteous shepherdesses,
was I born and nurtured in a station not so lowly, that
I might count myself the meanest of the village. My parents
are labourers and accustomed to field-labour, in which occupation
I followed them, leading a flock of simple sheep over the
common pastures of our village. So well did I adapt my
thoughts to the condition in which my lot had placed me, that
nothing gave me more joy than to see my flock multiply and
increase, and I had no other thought save how to gain for them
the richest and most fertile pastures, the clearest and freshest
waters I could find. I had not, nor could I have, cares beyond
those that might arise from the rustic duties on which I was
engaged. The woods were my companions, in whose solitude,
ofttimes invited by the sweet birds' gentle harmony, I sent forth
my voice in a thousand simple songs, without mingling therein
sighs or words that might give any token of a love-sick breast.
Ah! how often, merely to please myself and to allow the time
to pass away, did I wander from bank to bank, from vale to
vale, culling, here the white lily, there the purple iris, here the
red rose, there the fragrant pink, making from every kind of
sweet-smelling flowers a woven garland, wherewith I adorned
and bound up my hair; and then, viewing myself in the clear
and peaceful waters of some spring, I remained so joyous at
having seen myself, that I would not have changed my happiness
for any other! And how often did I make sport of some
maidens, who, thinking to find in my breast some manner of
pity for the misery theirs felt, disclosed to me, with abundance
of tears and sighs, the love-secrets of their soul! I remember
now, fair shepherdesses, that one day there came to me a girl
friend of mine: throwing her arms round my neck, and joining
her face to mine, she said to me with streaming eyes: "Ah,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
sister Teolinda!" (for this is the name of the hapless being
before you). "I truly believe the end of my days has come,
since love has not dealt with me as my desires deserved."
Whereupon I, wondering at her display of grief, thinking that
some great misfortune had befallen her, in the loss of her flock,
or the death of her father or brother, wiped her eyes with the
sleeve of my smock, and asked her to tell me what misfortune
it was that caused her to lament so much. She, continuing her
tears, nor giving truce to her sighs, said to me: "What greater
misfortune, oh Teolinda, would you have happen to me, than
that the son of the chief man in our village, whom I love more
than the very eyes in my head, should have gone away without
saying a word to me; and that I have this morning seen in
possession of Leocadia, daughter of the head shepherd Lisalco,
a crimson belt which I had given to that false Eugenio, whereby
was confirmed the suspicion I had of the love-affair the
traitor was carrying on with her?" When I ceased hearing
her complaints, I swear to you, friends and ladies mine, that
I could not cease from laughing within myself, and saying to
her: "By my faith, Lydia," (for so the unhappy girl was called)
"I thought from your complaints that you came stricken with
another and a greater wound. But now I know how void of
sense are you who fancy yourselves in love, in making much ado
about such childish things. Tell me on your life, dear Lydia,
what is the worth of a crimson belt, that it should grieve you to
see it in Leocadia's possession or to find that Eugenio has given
it to her? You would do better to consider your honour and
what concerns the pasturage of your sheep, and not to mix
yourself up with these fooleries of love, since we draw nothing
from them, so far as I see, but loss of honour and of peace."
When Lydia heard from me a reply so contrary to the one
she hoped for from my lips and pitying disposition, she did
nothing but bow her head, and adding tear to tear and sob to
sob, went from me; and after a little while, turning her head,
she said to me: "I pray God, Teolinda, that soon you may see
yourself in a state, compared to which you would count mine
happy, and that love may so treat you that you may tell your
grief to one who will value it and feel it in such wise as you have
done mine;" and therewith she went away, and I was left laughing
at her madness. But ah! poor me! I perceive clearly at
every moment that her curse is working in me, since even now
I fear that I am telling my grief to one who will sorrow but
little at having learnt it!'</p>

<p>Thereto Galatea replied: 'Would to God, discreet Teolinda,
that you might find a remedy for your loss as easily as you will
find in us pity for it, for you would soon lose the suspicion you
cherish of our sympathy.'</p>

<p>'Your lovely presence, sweet shepherdesses, and pleasant con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>verse,'
replied Teolinda, 'make me hope so; but my poor fortune
compels me to fear the contrary. Yet, come what may, I must
now tell you what I have promised you. With the freedom I
have told you, and in the pursuits I have related to you, I passed
my life so joyously and peacefully that desire knew not what to
bid me do, until avenging love came to exact from me a strict
account for the small account in which I held him, wherein he
vanquished me in such a way that though I am his slave I fancy
that he is not yet paid nor satisfied. It happened then, that one
day (which would have been for me the happiest of the days of
my life, had not time and season brought such a decrease to my
joys), I went with other shepherdesses of our village to cut
branches and gather rushes and flowers and green sword-lilies
to adorn the temple and streets of our native place; for the
following day was a most high festival, and the inhabitants of
our hamlet were bound by vow and promise to keep it. We
chanced to pass all together through a delightful wood
which is situated between the village and the river, where we
found a group of graceful shepherds, who were spending
the heat of the glowing noon-tide in the shade of the green
trees. When they saw us, we were at once recognised by
them, for they were all cousins or brothers or kinsmen
of ours, and coming to meet us and learning from us the
purpose we had in view, they persuaded and constrained us
with courteous words not to go farther, for that some of them
would fetch the branches and flowers for which we were going.
And so, being overcome by their prayers&mdash;they were so earnest&mdash;we
granted their desire, and forthwith six of the youngest,
equipped with their bill-hooks, went off in great glee to bring us
the green spoils we sought. We girls (there were six of us) went
to where the other shepherds stood; and they received us with all
courtesy, especially a strange shepherd who was there, known
to none of us, who was of such noble grace and spirit that all
stood wondering on seeing him, but I stood wondering and overcome.
I know not what to tell you, shepherdesses, save that as
soon as my eyes beheld him, I felt my heart grow tender and
there began to course through all my veins a frost that set me
aflame, and without knowing why, I felt my soul rejoice to have
set eyes on the handsome face of the unknown shepherd; and, in
a moment, though I was inexperienced in the ways of love, I
recognised that it was love that had stricken me; straightway had
I wished to make my plaint of him, if time and circumstances
had permitted. In short I then remained as now I am, overcome
and filled with love, though with more hope of recovery
than I now possess. Ah! how often in that hour did I long to
go to Lydia, who was with us, and say to her: "Forgive me, Lydia
dear, for the discourteous reply I gave you the other day, for I
would have you know that now I have more experience of the woe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
you complained of than you yourself!" One thing fills me with
wonder, how all the maidens there failed to see from the workings
of my face the secrets of my heart, and the cause of this must
have been that all the shepherds turned to the stranger and
begged him to finish the singing of a song he had begun before
we came up. He, without waiting to be pressed, continued the
song he had begun, with so exquisite and marvellous a voice
that all who listened to it were transported at hearing it. Then
at last I yielded myself all in all to all that love demanded,
without there being left in me more desire than if I had never
had any for anything in my life. And, although I was more
entranced than all on hearing the shepherd's sweet melody, yet
I did not fail to lend the greatest attention to what he sang in
his verses; for love had already brought me to such a pass
that it would have touched me to the soul, had I heard him
singing a lover's themes, since I would have fancied that his
thoughts were already engaged, and perchance in a quarter
where mine might have no share in what they desired. But
what he then sang was nothing but praises of the shepherd's lot
and the peaceful life of the fields, and some useful counsels for
the preservation of the flock; whereat I was not a little pleased;
for it seemed to me that if the shepherd had been in love, he
would have treated of naught but his love, since it is the way of
lovers to think time ill-spent which is spent on aught save
extolling and praising the cause of their griefs or joys. Mark,
friends, in how short a space I became mistress in the school of
love. The end of the shepherd's song and the first sight of those
who came with the branches occurred at the same moment;
and the youths, to one who saw them from afar, looked for all
the world like a little hillock moving along trees and all, as they
came in staid procession covered with branches. As they came
near us, the six all raised their voices, and, one beginning and
all replying, with tokens of the greatest joy and with many merry
shouts, began a graceful chant. Amidst this joy and happiness
they came nearer than I wished, for they deprived me of the
happiness I felt at the sight of the shepherd. When they had
laid down their green burden, we saw that each had a lovely
garland entwined round his arm, composed of various charming
flowers, which with graceful words they presented, one to each
of us, offering to carry the branches to the village; but we, full
of joy, thanked them for their fair courtesy and wished to return
to the village, when Eleuco, an old shepherd who was there,
said to us: "It will be well, fair shepherdesses, that you should
repay us for what our youths have done for you by leaving us the
garlands you are taking away over and above what you came to
seek; but it must be on condition that you give them to whomsoever
you think fit, with your own hands." "If you will be
satisfied by so small a return from us," replied one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
maidens, "I for my part am content," and taking the garland
with both hands placed it on the head of a gallant cousin of hers.
The others, guided by this example, gave theirs to different
youths who were there, all of them their kinsmen. I who
remained to the last, and had no kinsman there, affecting a certain
indifference, went up to the strange shepherd and placed the garland
on his head, saying to him: "For two reasons I give you this,
fair youth, one, for the pleasure you have given us all by your
charming song, the other, because in our village it is our custom
to honour strangers." All the bystanders were delighted with my
action, but how can I tell you what my soul felt when I saw
myself so near to him who had stolen it away? I can only say
that I would have given any happiness I could have wished for
at that moment (save that of loving him), to be able to encircle
his neck with my arms as I encircled his brows with the garland.
The shepherd bowed to me and with well-chosen words thanked
me for the favour I did him, and as he took his leave of me, stealing
the opportunity from the many eyes that were there, with low
voice said to me: "I have rewarded you, fair shepherdess, better
than you think, for the garland you have given me; you take a
pledge with you, and if you know how to value it, you will
perceive that you remain my debtor." I would gladly have
answered him, but such was the haste my companions imposed
on me that I had no chance of replying to him. In this wise I
returned to the village with a heart so different from that wherewith
I had set out that I myself marvelled at myself. Company
was irksome to me, and every thought that came to me and did
not tend to thinking of my shepherd, with much haste I strove
forthwith to put away from my mind as unworthy to occupy the
place that was full of loving cares. I know not how in so short
a time I became changed into a being other than that of old;
for I no longer lived in myself but in Artidoro (for such is the
name of the half of my soul I go seeking). Wherever I turned
my eyes, I seemed to see his face; whatever I heard, straightway
his gentle music and melody sounded in my ears; nowhere
did I move my feet but I had given my life, if he had desired it,
to find him there; in food I did not find the wonted savour nor
did my hands succeed in finding aught to give it. In a word, all
my senses were changed from their former state, nor did my
soul work through them as it was used to do. In the consideration
of the new Teolinda who was born within me, and in the contemplation
of the shepherd's grace that remained imprinted on
my soul, all that day passed away from me, and the night preceding
the solemn festival; and when this came, it was celebrated
with the greatest rejoicing and enthusiasm by all the inhabitants
of our village and of the neighbouring places. After the sacred
offerings in the temple were ended and the ceremonies due
performed, well-nigh most of the people of the hamlet came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>gether
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">in a broad square before the temple, beneath the shade</span><br />
of four ancient leafy poplars which were therein, and all forming a
circle, left a space for the youths from near and far to disport
themselves in honour of the festival in various pastoral games.
Straightway on the instant a goodly number of fit and lusty
shepherds showed themselves in the square, and giving joyous
tokens of their youth and skill, began a thousand graceful games.
Now they tossed the heavy caber, now they showed the lightness
of their supple limbs in unwonted leaps, now they revealed their
great strength and dexterous craft in complicated wrestling
bouts, now they proved the swiftness of their feet in long races, each
one striving so to acquit himself in all that he might win the first
prize out of the many the chief men of the village had offered for
the best who should excel in such sports; but in these I have mentioned,
and in many others which I pass by so as not to be tedious,
none of all the neighbours or men of the district present achieved
as much as my Artidoro, who chose by his presence to honour
and gladden our festival, and to carry off the highest honour and
prize in all the games that were held. Such, shepherdesses, was
his skill and spirit, so great the praises all gave him, that I grew
proud, and an unwonted joy revelled in my breast at the mere
reflection that I had known to fill my thoughts so well. But
despite this it gave me very great grief that Artidoro, being a
stranger, would have soon to depart from our village; and, if he
went away without at least knowing what he took from me&mdash;that
is, my soul&mdash;what a life would be mine in his absence, or how
could I forget my sorrow, at least by lamenting, since I had no
one to complain of save myself? Whilst I was occupied with
these fancies, the festival and rejoicing ended; and when Artidoro
would have taken leave of the shepherds, his friends, they
all joined in asking him to spend with them the eight remaining
days of the festival, if nothing more pleasing prevented it.
"Nothing can give me greater pleasure, kind shepherds," replied
Artidoro, "than to serve you in this and all else that your wish
may be; for although it was my wish now to go and seek a
brother of mine, who has for a few days been missing from our
village, I will fulfil your desire, since it is I who gain thereby."
All thanked him greatly, and were pleased at his remaining;
but I was more so, thinking that in those eight days an opportunity
could not fail to present itself to me, when I might reveal
to him what I could no longer conceal. We spent nearly all
that night in dances and games, and in telling one another the
feats we had seen the shepherds perform that day, saying: "Such
a one danced better than such a one, though so and so knew
more turns than so and so; Mingo threw Bras, but Bras ran
better than Mingo;" and finally, all came to the conclusion that
Artidoro, the strange shepherd, bore off the palm from all, each
one praising in detail his graces one by one; and all these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
praises, I have already said, redounded to my delight. When
the morning of the day after the festival came, before fresh dawn
lost the pearly dew from her lovely locks, and the sun had fully
displayed his rays on the peaks of the neighbouring mountains,
some twelve of us shepherdesses, the most admired of the village,
came together, and, linking hands, to the sound of a flageolet
and a bagpipe, weaving and unweaving intricate turns and dance-movements,
we went from the village to a green meadow not far
away, giving great pleasure to all who saw our mazy dance.
And fortune, which so far was guiding my affair from good to
better, ordained that in that same meadow we should find all the
shepherds of the place, and Artidoro with them. When they
saw us, straightway attuning the sound of a tabor they had to
that of our pipes, they came forth to meet us with the same
measure and dance, mingling with us in bewildering but well-ordered
maze; and as the instruments changed their note, we
changed the dance, so that we shepherdesses had to unlink and
give our hands to the shepherds; and my good fortune willed
that I should chance to give mine to Artidoro. I know not, my
friends, how to describe fully to you what I felt at such a
moment, unless by telling you that I was so perturbed, that
I failed to keep fitting step in the dance; so much so that
Artidoro was obliged to draw me violently after him, in order
that the thread of the measured dance might not be broken if
he let me go. Seizing the opportunity for it, I said to him:
"Wherein has my hand offended you, Artidoro, that you press
it so hard?" He replied in a voice that could be heard by
none: "Nay, what has my soul done to you that you use it so
ill?" "My offence is clear," I replied gently; "but for yours,
neither do I see it, nor will it be seen." "This is just the mischief,"
replied Artidoro, "that you can see your way to do evil,
but not to cure it." Herewith our discourse ended, for the
dancing ended, and I remained happy and thoughtful at what
Artidoro had said to me; and though I thought they were
loving words, they did not convince me that they came from
one in love. Straightway we all, shepherds and shepherdesses,
sate down on the green grass; and when we had rested a while
from the fatigue of the dances that were over, the aged Eleuco,
attuning his instrument, which was a rebeck, to the pipe of
another shepherd, asked Artidoro to sing something, for he
should so rather than any other, since Heaven had bestowed
such talent on him that it were ingratitude to wish to conceal it.
Artidoro, thanking Eleuco for the praises he gave him, straightway
began to sing some verses; and I fixed them in my
memory, since the words he had spoken to me before had
given me a suspicion, so that even now I have not forgotten
them. Though it may be irksome to you to hear them, I shall
have to repeat them to you, only because they are needful for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
you to understand, stage by stage, through what stages love has
brought me to the pass in which I find myself. They are as
follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wild, close-confined and gloomy be his night,</span><br />
Never may he behold the longed-for day,<br />
Incessant and unending be his woe,<br />
Far, far away from bliss, and joy, and laughter,<br />
Ought he to be, wrapt in a living death,<br />
Whoso without sweet Love shall spend his life.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Full though it be of joyousness, yet life</span><br />
Naught save the shade can be of briefest night,<br />
The veritable counterfeit of death,<br />
If during all the hours that fill the day<br />
It doth not silence every pang of woe,<br />
And gladly, gladly welcome Love's sweet laughter.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where liveth gentle Love, there liveth laughter,</span><br />
And where Love dieth, dieth too our life,<br />
Our choicest pleasure is transformed to woe,<br />
Into the darkness of eternal night<br />
Is changed the radiance of the peaceful day,<br />
Life without Love is naught but bitter death.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dangers wherein the issue is but death</span><br />
The lover doth not flee: rather with laughter<br />
He seeks his chance and longeth for the day,<br />
When he may offer up his treasured life&mdash;<br />
Until he shall behold the last calm night&mdash;<br />
Unto Love's flame, and unto Love's sweet woe.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">The woe that is of Love, we call not woe,</span><br />
Nor yet the death that Love bestoweth, death:<br />
Let none to Love's night give the name of night,<br />
Nor call Love's laughter by the name of laughter.<br />
His life alone can be accounted life,<br />
Our only merriment his joyous day.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh blest, thrice-blest to me this happy day,</span><br />
Whereon I can restrain my bitter woe,<br />
Rejoicing that I have bestowed my life<br />
On her who can bestow or life or death!<br />
What will it be, what can I hope save laughter<br />
From that proud face that turns the sun to night?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Love hath my cloudy night to cloudless day</span><br />
Transformed, to laughter my increasing woe,<br />
And my approaching death to length of life.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">These were the verses, fair shepherdesses, which my Artidoro
sang that day with wondrous grace and no less pleasure on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
part of those that heard him. From them, and from the words
he had spoken to me before, I took occasion to consider if by
chance the sight of me had caused some new sensation of love
in Artidoro's breast; and my suspicion did not turn out so vain,
but that he himself justified it to me on our return to the village.'</p>

<p>Teolinda had reached this point in the tale of her love, when
the shepherdesses heard a great uproar of shepherds shouting
and dogs barking. This caused them to end the discourse they
had begun, and to stop and observe through the branches what
it was; in this way they saw a pack of hounds crossing a green
plain on their right hand, in pursuit of a timid hare, that was
coming with all speed to take shelter in the dense underwood.
It was not long before the shepherdesses saw it coming to the
same place where they were, and going straight to Galatea's
side. There, overcome by the fatigue of its long course, and
almost as it were safe from the peril nigh at hand, it sank down
on the ground with such wearied breath, that it seemed on the
point of breathing its last. The hounds pursued it by scent and
track, until they came to where the shepherdesses were; but
Galatea, taking the timid hare in her arms, checked the vengeful
purpose of the eager hounds, for it seemed to her not to be
right to fail to defend a creature that had sought her aid. Soon
after there approached some shepherds, following the hounds
and the hare; and amongst them came Galatea's father, out of
respect for whom Florisa, Teolinda and she went out to meet
him with due courtesy. He and the shepherds were filled with
wonder at Teolinda's beauty, and desired to know who she was,
for they saw clearly that she was a stranger. Galatea and
Florisa were not a little annoyed at their approach, seeing that
it had robbed them of the pleasure of learning the issue of
Teolinda's love; and they asked her to be good enough not to
leave their company for some days, if the accomplishment of
her desires were not by chance hindered thereby.</p>

<p>'Nay, rather,' replied Teolinda, 'it suits me to remain a day
or two on this bank, to see if they can be accomplished; and on
this account, as also not to leave unfinished the story I have
begun, I must do what you bid me.'</p>

<p>Galatea and Florisa embraced her, and offered her their
friendship anew, and to serve her to the best of their power.
Meanwhile Galatea's father and the other shepherds, having
spread their cloaks on the margin of the clear stream, and
drawn from their wallets some country fare, invited Galatea and
her companions to eat with them. They accepted the invitation,
and, sitting down forthwith, they sated their hunger, which was
beginning to weary them as the day was already far spent. In
the course of these doings, and of some stories the shepherds
told to pass the time, the accustomed hour approached for
returning to the village. Straightway Galatea and Florisa,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
returning to their flocks, collected them once more, and, in the
company of fair Teolinda and the other shepherds, gradually
made their way to the hamlet; and at the break of the hill where
that morning they had happened on Elicio, they all heard the
pipe of the unloving Lenio, a shepherd in whose breast love
could never take up his abode; and thereat he lived in such joy
and content, that in whatever converse or gathering of shepherds
he found himself, his sole intent was to speak ill of love and
lovers, and all his songs tended to this end. By reason of this
strange disposition of his, he was known by all the shepherds in
all those parts, and by some he was loathed, by others held in
esteem. Galatea and those who came there stopped to listen,
to see if Lenio was singing anything, as was his wont, and
straightway they saw him give his pipe to a companion, and
begin to sing what follows to its sound:</p>

<p class="p01">L<small>ENIO.</small></p>

<p class="p01">At the time that Lenio was singing what you have heard,
Elicio and Erastro had already come up with their flocks in the
company of the hapless Lisandro; and Elicio, thinking that
Lenio's tongue in speaking ill of love went beyond what was
right, wished clearly to show him his error, and, adopting the
very theme of the verses he had sung, at the moment Galatea,
Florisa, Teolinda and the other shepherds came up, to the sound
of Erastro's pipe he began to sing in this wise:</p>

<p class="p01">The shepherds given to love felt no small pleasure at seeing
how well Elicio defended his view: but the loveless Lenio did
not on this account cease to remain firm in his opinion; nay,
rather, he sought anew to resume his song and to show in what
he sang how ineffectual Elicio's reasonings were to darken the
bright truth which, following his judgment, he upheld. But
Galatea's father, who was called Aurelio the venerable, said
to him:</p>

<p>'Don't weary yourself for the present, discreet Lenio, in seek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>ing
to show us in your song what you feel in your heart, for the
road from here to the village is short, and it seems to me more
time is needed than you think to defend yourself against the
many who hold a view contrary to yours. Keep your reasonings
for a more convenient spot, for some day you and Elicio with
other shepherds will be together at the spring of slates or the
stream of palms, where, with greater ease and comfort, you may
be able to discuss and make clear your different opinions.'</p>

<p>'The opinion Elicio holds is mere opinion,' replied Lenio, 'but
mine is absolute knowledge, and proved, which, sooner or later,
forced me to uphold it, seeing that it carried truth with it; but,
as you say, there will not fail a time more fitting for this end.'</p>

<p>'This will I arrange,' answered Elicio, 'for it grieves me that
so fine an intellect as yours, friend Lenio, should lack what
might improve it and enhance it, like the pure and true love whose
enemy you show yourself.'</p>

<p>'You are deceived, Elicio,' replied Lenio, 'if you think by
specious words and sophisms to make me change principles I
would not hold it manly to change.'</p>

<p>'It is as wrong,' said Elicio, 'to persist in wrong, as it is good
to persevere in good, and I have always heard my elders say it
is the part of the wise to take counsel.'</p>

<p>'I do not deny that,' answered Lenio, 'whenever I see that
my judgment is not correct; but so long as experience and
reason do not show me the contrary to what they have shown
me hitherto, I believe that my opinion is as true as yours is false.'</p>

<p>'If the heretics of love were to be punished,' said Erastro at
this point, 'I would begin from this moment, friend Lenio, to
cut wood wherewith to burn you for the greatest heretic and
enemy that love has.'</p>

<p>'And even though I saw naught of love, save that you,
Erastro, follow it, and are of the band of lovers,' replied Lenio,
'that alone would suffice to make me renounce it with a hundred
thousand tongues, if a hundred thousand I had.'</p>

<p>'Do you think then, Lenio,' answered Erastro, 'that I am not
fit to be a lover?'</p>

<p>'Nay,' replied Lenio, 'I think that men of your disposition
and understanding are fitted to be among love's servants; for
he who is lame falls to the ground at the slightest stumble, and
he who has little wisdom, wants but little time to lose it all;
and as for those who follow the banner of this your valorous
captain, I for my part hold that they are not the wisest in the
world; and if they have been, they ceased to be it, the moment
they fell in love.'</p>

<p>Great was the displeasure Erastro felt at what Lenio said, and
thus he answered him:</p>

<p>'I think, Lenio, your insane reasonings deserve another
punishment than words; but I hope that some day you will pay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
for what you have just said, without being aided by what you
might say in your defence.'</p>

<p>'If I knew of you, Erastro,' answered Lenio, 'that you were
as brave as you are fond, your threats would not fail to fill me
with dread: but, as I know you are as backward in the one, as
in the other you are to the fore, they cause laughter in me rather
than terror.'</p>

<p>Here Erastro lost all patience, and if it had not been for
Lisandro and Elicio, who placed themselves between, he had
replied to Lenio with his fists; for by this time his tongue, confused
with rage, could scarce perform its office. Great was the
pleasure all felt at the sprightly quarrel of the shepherds, and
more at the rage and displeasure Erastro displayed; for it was
necessary that Galatea's father should make peace between
Lenio and him, though Erastro, if it had not been for fear of
losing the respect of his lady's father, would in no way have
made it. As soon as the matter was ended, all with rejoicing
went their way to the village, and whilst they were going, the
fair Florisa, to the sound of Galatea's pipe, sang this sonnet:</p>

<p class="p01">Short indeed was the road to the shepherds, beguiled and
entertained by the charming voice of Florisa, who ceased not her
song till they were quite near the village and the huts of Elicio
and Erastro, who stopped there with Lisandro, first taking leave
of the venerable Aurelio, Galatea, and Florisa, who went with
Teolinda to the village, the remaining shepherds going each to
where he had his hut. That same night the hapless Lisandro
asked leave of Elicio to return to his country or to where he
might, in harmony with his desire, finish the little of life that,
as he thought, remained to him. Elicio with all the arguments
he could urge on him, and with the endless offers of true
friendship he made him, could by no means prevail on him
to remain in his company even for a few days; and so the luckless
shepherd, embracing Elicio with many tears and sighs, took
leave of him, promising to inform him of his condition wherever
he might be. Elicio, having accompanied him half a league
from his hut, again embraced him closely; and making again
fresh offers, they parted, Elicio being in great grief for what
Lisandro suffered. And so he returned to his hut to spend the
greater part of the night in amorous fancies and to await the
coming day that he might enjoy the happiness the sight of
Galatea caused him. And she, when she reached her village,
desiring to learn the issue of Teolinda's love, arranged so that
Florisa, Teolinda and she might be alone that night; and finding
the opportunity she desired, the love-sick shepherdess
continued her story as will be seen in the second book.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
</div>

<h2 class="nobreak">BOOK II.</h2>


<p>Being now free and relieved from what they had to do that
night with their flocks, they arranged to retire and withdraw
with Teolinda to a spot where they might, without being hindered
by anyone, hear what was lacking of the issue of her love. And
so they betook themselves to a little garden by Galatea's house;
and, the three seating themselves beneath a stately green vine
which entwined itself in an intricate manner along some wooden
network, Teolinda repeated once more some words of what she
had said before and went on, saying:</p>

<p>'After our dance and Artidoro's song were ended, as I have
already told you, fair shepherdesses, it seemed good to all of us
to return to the village to perform in the temple the solemn rites,
and because it likewise seemed to us that the solemnity of the
feast in some way gave us liberty; but not being so punctilious
as to seclusion, we enjoyed ourselves with more freedom.
Wherefore we all, shepherds and shepherdesses, in a confused
mass, with gladness and rejoicing returned to the village,
speaking each with the one who pleased him best. Fate, and
my care, and Artidoro's solicitude also ordained that, without any
display of artifice in the matter, we two kept apart from the rest
in such a manner that on the way we might safely have said
more than what we did say, if each of us had not respected what
we owed to ourselves and to each other. At length I said to
him, to draw him out, as the saying goes: "The days you have
spent in our village, Artidoro, will be years to you, since in your
own you must have things to occupy you which must give you
greater pleasure." "All that I can hope for in my life," replied
Artidoro, "would I exchange, if only the days I have to spend
here might be, not years, but centuries, since, when they come
to an end, I do not hope to pass others that may give me greater
joy." "Is the joy you feel so great," I replied, "at seeing our
festivals?" "It does not arise from this," he answered, "but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>
from regarding the beauty of the shepherdesses of your village."
"In truth," I retorted, "pretty girls must be wanting in yours."
"The truth is that they are not wanting there," he replied, "but
that here there is a superabundance, so that one single one I
have seen is enough for those of yonder place to count themselves
ugly compared to her." "Your courtesy makes you say
this, oh Artidoro," I replied, "for I know full well that in this
hamlet there is no one who excels so much as you say." "I
know better that what I say is true," he answered, "since I have
seen the one and beheld the others." "Perhaps you beheld her
from afar, and the distance between," said I, "made you see a
different thing from what it really was." "In the same way," he
replied, "as I see and am beholding you now, I beheld and saw
her. Happy should I be to have been mistaken, if her disposition
does not agree with her beauty." "It would not grieve
me to be the one you say, for the pleasure she must feel who
sees herself proclaimed and accounted beautiful." "I would
much rather that you were not," replied Artidoro. "Then what
would you lose," I answered, "if instead of not being the one you
say, I were?" "What I have gained, I know full well," he
replied, "as to what I have to lose, I am doubtful and in fear."
"You know well how to play the lover, Artidoro," said I. "You
know better how to inspire love, Teolinda," he replied. Thereon
I said to him, "I do not know if I should tell you, Artidoro, that
I wish neither of us to be deceived." Whereto he replied, "I
am quite sure that I am not deceived, and it is in your hands to
seek to undeceive yourself as often as you seek to make trial of
the pure desire I have to serve you." "I will reward you for
that," I answered, "with the same desire; for it seems to me
that it would not be well to remain indebted to anybody where
the cost is so small." At this moment, without his having a
chance to reply to me, the head-shepherd Eleuco came up,
saying in a loud voice: "Ho, gay shepherds and fair shepherdesses,
make them hear our approach in the village, you
singing some chant, maidens, so that we can reply to you, in
order that the people of the hamlet may see how much we who
are on our way here, do to make our festival joyous." And
because in nothing that Eleuco commanded did he fail to be
obeyed, straightway the shepherds beckoned to me to begin;
and so, availing myself of the opportunity, and profiting by what
had passed with Artidoro, I commenced this chant:</p>

<p class="p01">'I know not, fair shepherdesses, if in singing what you have
heard I succeeded; but I know very well that Artidoro knew
how to profit by it, since all the time he was in our village,
though he often spoke to me, it was with so much reserve,
secrecy, and modesty that idle eyes and chattering tongues
neither had nor saw aught to say that might be prejudicial to
our honour. But in the fear I had that, when the period
Artidoro had promised to spend in our village was ended, he
would have to go to his own, I sought, though at the cost of my
modesty, that my heart should not remain with the regret of
having kept silence on what it were useless to speak afterwards,
when Artidoro had gone. And so, after my eyes gave leave
for his most beauteous eyes to gaze on me lovingly, our tongues
were not still, nor failed to show with words what up till then the
eyes had so clearly declared by sign. Finally, you must know,
friends, that one day when I found myself by chance alone with
Artidoro, he disclosed to me, with tokens of an ardent love and
courtesy, the true and honourable love he felt for me; and
though I would have wished to play the reluctant prude, yet,
because I was afraid, as I have already told you, that he would
go, I did not wish to disdain him nor to dismiss him, and also
because it seemed to me that the lack of sympathy, inspired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
or felt at the beginning of a love-affair, is the reason why those
who are not very experienced in their passion, abandon and
leave the enterprise they have begun. Wherefore I gave him
answer such as I desired to give him. We agreed in the resolve
that he should repair to his village, and a few days after
should by some honourable mediation send to ask me in
marriage from my parents; whereat he was so happy and
content that he did not cease to call the day fortunate on which
his eyes beheld me. As for me, I can tell you that I would not
have changed my happiness for any other that could be
imagined; for I was sure that Artidoro's worth and good
qualities were such that my father would be happy to receive
him as a son-in-law. The happy climax you have heard,
shepherdesses, was the climax of our love, for only two or three
days remained before Artidoro's departure, when fortune, as
one who never set bounds to her designs, ordained that a
sister of mine, a little younger than I, should return to our
village from another where she had been for some days, in the
house of an aunt of ours who was ill. And in order that you
may see, ladies, what strange and unthought-of chances happen
in the world, I would have you know a fact which I think will
not fail to cause in you some strange feeling of wonder: it is
that this sister of mine I have told you of, who up till then
had been away, resembles me so much in face, stature, grace,
and spirit (if I have any), that not merely those of our hamlet,
but our very parents have often mistaken us, and spoken to
the one for the other, so that, not to fall into this error, they
distinguished us by the differences of our dresses, which were
different. In one thing only, as I believe, did Nature make
us quite different, namely, in disposition, my sister's being
harsher than my happiness required, since, because of her
being less compassionate than sharp-witted, I shall have to
weep as long as my life endures. It happened, then, that as
soon as my sister came to the village desiring to resume the
rustic duties that were pleasing to her, she rose next day earlier
than I wished, and went off to the meadow with the very sheep
I used to lead; and though I wished to follow her by reason
of the happiness which followed to me from the sight of my
Artidoro, for some reason or other my mother kept me at home
the whole of that day, which was the last of my joys. For
that night my sister, having brought back her flock, told me
as in secret that she had to tell me something of great importance
to me. I, who might have imagined anything rather than
what she said to me, arranged that we should soon see each
other alone, when with face somewhat moved, I hanging on
her words, she began to say to me: "I know not, sister mine,
what to think of your honour, nor yet whether I should be
silent on what I cannot refrain from telling you, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
see if you give me any excuse for the fault I imagine you
are guilty of: and though, as a younger sister, I should have
addressed you with more respect, you must forgive me; for
in what I have seen to-day you will find the excuse for what I
say to you." When I heard her speaking in this way I knew
not what to answer her except to tell her to go on with her
discourse. "You must know, sister," she proceeded, "that this
morning when I went forth with our sheep to the meadow, and
was going alone with them along the bank of our cool Henares,
as I passed through the glade of counsel there came out towards
me a shepherd whom I can truly swear I have never seen
in our district; and with a strange freedom of manner he began
to greet me so lovingly that I stood shamed and confused,
not knowing what to answer him. Failing to take warning from
the anger which I fancy I showed in my face, he came up to me,
saying to me: 'What silence is this, fair Teolinda, last refuge of
this soul that adores you?' And he was on the point of taking
my hands to kiss them, adding to what I have said a whole list
of endearments, which it seemed he brought ready prepared.
At once I understood, seeing that he was falling into the error
many others have fallen into, and thinking he was speaking
with you; whence a suspicion arose in me that if you, sister, had
never seen him, nor treated him with familiarity, it would not be
possible for him to have the boldness to speak to you in that
way. Whereat I felt so great a rage that I could scarcely form
words to answer him, but at last I replied to him in the way his
boldness deserved, and as it seemed to me you, sister, would
have had to answer anyone speaking to you so freely; and if it
had not been that the shepherdess Licea came up at that
moment, I had added such words that he would truly have
repented addressing his to me. And the best of it is that I
never chose to tell him of the error he was in, but that he
believed I was Teolinda, as if he had been speaking with you
yourself. At last he went off, calling me thankless, ungrateful,
one who showed little return; and from what I can judge from
the expression he bore, I assure you, sister, he will not dare
speak to you again though he should meet you all alone. What
I want to know is who is this shepherd, and what converse has
been between you, whence it comes that he dare speak to
you with such freedom?" To your great discretion, discreet
shepherdesses, I leave it to imagine what my soul would feel on
hearing what my sister told me: but at length, dissembling
as best I could, I said to her: "You have done me the greatest
favour in the world, sister Leonarda," (for so was called the
disturber of my peace) "in having by your harsh words rid me of
the disgust and turmoil caused me by the importunities you
mention of this shepherd. He is a stranger who for eight days
has been in our village, whose thoughts are full of arrogance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
and folly, so great that wherever he sees me he treats me as you
have seen, giving himself up to the belief that he has won my
good-will; and though I have undeceived him, perhaps with
harsher words than you said to him, nevertheless he does not
cease to persist in his vain purpose. I assure you, sister, that I
wish the new day were here that I might go and tell him that if
he does not desist from his vain hope, he may expect the end to
it which my words have always indicated to him." And it was
indeed true, sweet friends, that I would have given all that
might have been asked of me, if it had but been dawn, only that
I might go and see my Artidoro, and undeceive him of the error
he had fallen into, fearing lest through the bitter and petulant
reply my sister had given him he should be disdainful and
do something to prejudice our agreement. The long nights
of rough December were not more irksome to the lover hoping
some happiness from the coming day than was that night
distasteful to me, though it was one of the short nights of
summer, since I longed for the new light to go and see the
light whereby my eyes saw. And so, before the stars wholly
lost their brightness, being even in doubt whether it were night
or day, constrained by my longing, on the pretext of going to
pasture my sheep, I went forth from the village, and hurrying
the flock more than usual to urge it on, reached the spot where
at other times I was wont to find Artidoro, which I found
deserted and without anything to give me indication of him;
whereat my heart throbbed violently within me, for it almost
guessed the evil which was in store for it. How often, seeing
that I did not find him, did I wish to beat the air with my
voice, calling out my Artidoro's beloved name, and to say,
"Come, my joy, I am the true Teolinda, who longs for you and
loves you more than herself!" But fear lest my words might be
heard by another than him, made me keep more silent than I
should have wished. And so, after I had traversed once and
yet again all the bank and wood of the gentle Henares, I sat me
down, wearied, at the foot of a green willow, waiting until the
bright sun should with his rays spread over all the face of
the earth, so that in his brightness there might not remain
thicket, cave, copse, cottage, or hut where I might not go seeking
my joy. But scarcely had the new light given opportunity
to distinguish colours, when straightway a rough-barked poplar,
which was before me, presented itself to my eyes: on it and
on many others I saw some letters written, which I at once
recognised to be from Artidoro's hand, set there; and rising in
haste to see what they said, I saw, fair shepherdesses, that it
was this:</p>

<p class="p01">'What words will suffice, shepherdesses, to make you understand
the extremity of grief that seized upon my heart, when I
clearly understood that the verses I had read were my beloved
Artidoro's? But there is no reason why I should make too much
of it to you, since it did not go as far as was needed to end my
life, which thenceforward I have held in such loathing, that I
would not feel, nor could there come to me, a greater pleasure
than to lose it. So great and of such a kind were the sighs I
then gave forth, the tears I shed, the piteous cries I uttered,
that none who had heard me but would have taken me for mad.
In short, I remained in such a state, that, without considering
what I owed to my honour, I determined to forsake my dear native
land, beloved parents and cherished brothers, and to leave my
simple flock to take care of itself; and, without heeding aught
else save what I deemed to be necessary for my satisfaction,
that very morning, embracing a thousand times the bark where
my Artidoro's hand had been, I departed from that place with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
the intent to come to these banks where I know Artidoro has
and makes his abode, to see if he has been so inconsiderate and
cruel to himself, as to put into practice what he left written in
his last verses: for if it were so, henceforward I promise you,
my friends, that the desire and haste with which I shall follow
him in death, shall be no less than the willingness with which I
have loved him in life. But, woe is me! I verily believe there is no
foreboding which may be to my hurt but will turn out true, for
it is now nine days since I came to these cool banks, and all this
while I have learnt no tidings of what I desire; and may it
please God that when I learn them, it may not be the worst I
forebode. Here you see, discreet maidens, the mournful issue
of my life of love. I have now told you who I am and what I
seek; if you have any tidings of my happiness, may fortune grant
you the greatest you desire, so that you do not withhold it from me.'</p>

<p>With such tears did the loving shepherdess accompany the
words she uttered, that he would have had a heart of steel who
had not grieved at them. Galatea and Florisa, who were
naturally of a pitying disposition, could not hold theirs back,
nor yet did they fail to comfort her with the most soothing and
helpful words in their power, counselling her to remain some
days in their company; that perhaps her fortune would in the
meantime cause her to learn some tidings of Artidoro, since
Heaven would not allow a shepherd so discreet as she depicted
him by reason of so strange an error to end the course of his
youthful years; that it might be that Artidoro, his thought
having in course of time returned to better course and purpose,
might return to see the native land he longed for and his sweet
friends; and that she might, therefore, hope to find him there
better than elsewhere. The shepherdess, somewhat consoled by
these and other reasonings, was pleased to remain with them,
thanking them for the favour they did her, and for the desire
they showed to secure her happiness. At this moment the
serene night, urging on her starry car through the sky, gave
token that the new day was approaching; and the shepherdesses,
in desire and need of rest, arose and repaired from the cool
garden to their dwellings. But scarce had the bright sun with
his warm rays scattered and consumed the dense mist, which on
cool mornings is wont to spread through the air, when the
three shepherdesses, leaving their lazy couches, returned to the
wonted pursuit of grazing their flock, Galatea and Florisa with
thoughts far different from that cherished by the fair Teolinda,
who went her way so sad and thoughtful that it was a marvel.
And for this reason, Galatea, to see if she might in some way
distract her, begged her to lay aside her melancholy for a while,
and be so good as to sing some verses to the sound of Florisa's
pipe. To this Teolinda replied:</p>

<p>'If I thought that the great cause I have for weeping, despite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
the slight cause I have for singing, would be diminished in any
way, you might well forgive me, fair Galatea, for not doing what
you bid me; but as I already know by experience that what my
tongue utters in song, my heart confirms with weeping, I will
do what you wish, since thereby I shall satisfy your desire
without going contrary to mine.'</p>

<p>And straightway the shepherdess Florisa played her pipe, to
the sound of which Teolinda sang this sonnet:</p>

<p class="p01">T<small>EOLINDA.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"> Whither a flagrant cruel lie doth go,</div>
<div class="verse">This have I learned from my grievous state,</div>
<div class="verse">And how Love with my hurt doth meditate</div>
<div class="verse">The life that fear denies me, to bestow.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">To dwell within my flesh my soul doth cease,</div>
<div class="verse">Following his soul that by some mystic fate</div>
<div class="verse">In pain hath placed it, and in woe so great</div>
<div class="verse">That happiness brings strife, and sorrow peace.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">If I do live, 'tis hope that makes me live,</div>
<div class="verse">Hope, that, though slight and weak, doth upward mount,</div>
<div class="verse">Clinging unto the strength my love doth give.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">Ah firm beginning, transformation frail,</div>
<div class="verse">Bitterest total of a sweet account!</div>
<div class="verse">Amidst your persecutions life must fail.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">Teolinda had scarcely ceased singing the sonnet you have
heard, when, on their right hand, on the slope of the cool vale,
the three shepherdesses became aware of the sound of a pipe,
whose sweetness was such that all halted and stood still, to enjoy
the sweet harmony with more attention. And anon they heard
the sound of a small rebeck, attuning itself to that of the pipe
with grace and skill so great that the two shepherdesses Galatea
and Florisa stood rapt, wondering what shepherds they might
be who played with such harmony; for they clearly saw that none
of those they knew was so skilled in music, unless it were Elicio.</p>

<p>'At this moment,' said Teolinda, 'if my ears deceive me not,
fair shepherdesses, I think you now have on your banks the two
renowned and famous shepherds Thyrsis and Damon, natives of
my country&mdash;at least Thyrsis is, who was born in famous Compluto,
a town founded on our Henares' banks; and Damon, his
intimate and perfect friend, if I am not ill informed, draws his
origin from the mountains of León, and was nurtured in Mantua
Carpentanea, the renowned. Both are so excellent in every
manner of discretion, learning and praiseworthy pursuits, that
not only are they known within the boundaries of our district,
but they are known and esteemed throughout all the boundaries
of the land; and think not, shepherdesses, that the genius of
these two shepherds extends merely to knowing what befits the
shepherd's lot, for it passes so far beyond that they teach and
dispute of the hidden things of Heaven and the unknown things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
of earth, in terms and modes agreed upon. And I am perplexed
to think what cause will have moved them to leave, Thyrsis his
sweet and beloved Phyllis, Damon his fair and modest Amaryllis;
Phyllis by Thyrsis, Amaryllis by Damon so beloved, that
there is in our village or its environs no person, nor in the
district a wood, meadow, spring or stream, that does not know
full well their warm and modest love.'</p>

<p>'Cease at present, Teolinda,' said Florisa, 'to praise these
shepherds to us, for it profits us more to hear what they
sing as they come, since it seems to me that they have no less
charm in their voices than in the music of their instruments.'</p>

<p>'What will you say,' Teolinda then replied, 'when you see all
this surpassed by the excellence of their poetry, which is of such
a kind that for the one it has already gained the epithet of
divine, and for the other that of superhuman?'</p>

<p>The shepherdesses, whilst engaged in this discourse, saw, on
the slope of the vale along which they themselves were going,
two shepherds appear, of gallant bearing and abounding spirit,
one a little older than the other; so well dressed, though in
shepherd's garb, that in their carriage and appearance they
seemed more like brave courtiers than mountain herdsmen.
Each wore a well-cut garment of finest white wool, trimmed with
tawny red and grey, colours which their shepherdesses fancied
most. Each had hanging from his shoulder a wallet no less
handsome and adorned than the garments. They came crowned
with green laurel and cool ivy, with their twisted crooks placed
under their arms. They brought no companion, and came so
rapt in their music that they were for a long while without seeing
the fixed shepherdesses, who were wending their way along the same
slope, wondering not a little at the gentle grace and charm of
the shepherds, who, with voices attuned to the same chant, one
beginning and the other replying, sang this which follows:</p>

<p class="p01">Here ceased the exquisite song of the graceful shepherds, but
not as regards the pleasure the shepherdesses had felt at
listening to it; rather they would have wished it not to end
so soon, for it was one of those lays that are but rarely heard.
At this moment the two gallant shepherds bent their steps in
the direction where the shepherdesses were, whereat Teolinda
was grieved, for she feared to be recognised by them; and
for this reason she asked Galatea that they might go away
from that place. She did it, and the shepherds passed by,
and as they passed Galatea heard Thyrsis saying to Damon:</p>

<p>'These banks, friend Damon, are those on which the fair
Galatea grazes her flocks, and to which the loving Elicio
brings his, your intimate and special friend, to whom may
fortune give such issue in his love as his honourable and
good desires deserve. For many days I have not known to
what straits his lot has brought him; but from what I have
heard tell of the coy disposition of discreet Galatea, for whom
he is dying, I fear he must be full of woe long before he is
content.'</p>

<p>'I would not be astonished at this,' replied Damon, 'for
with all the graces and special gifts wherewith Heaven has
enriched Galatea, it has after all made her a woman, in
which frail object is not always the gratitude that is due, and
which he needs whose smallest risk for them is life. What
I have heard tell of Elicio's love is that he adores Galatea
without passing beyond the bounds that are due to her
modesty, and that Galatea's discretion is so great that she
does not give proofs of loving or of loathing Elicio; and so
the hapless swain must go on subject to a thousand contrary
chances, waiting on time and fortune (means hopeless enough)
to shorten or lengthen his life, but which are more likely to
shorten it than to sustain it.'</p>

<p>So far Galatea could hear what the shepherds, as they went
along, said of her and of Elicio, whereat she felt no small
pleasure, understanding that what report published of her
affairs was what was due to her pure intent; and from that
moment she determined not to do for Elicio anything that
might give report a chance of speaking false in what it
published of her thoughts. At this moment the two brave
shepherds were gradually wending their way with loitering
steps towards the village, desiring to be present at the nuptials
of the happy shepherd Daranio, who was marrying Silveria of
the green eyes, and this was one of the reasons why they
had left their flocks, and were coming to Galatea's hamlet.
But, when but little of the way remained to be covered, they
heard on its right side the sound of a rebeck which sounded
harmoniously and sweetly; and Damon stopping caught
Thyrsis by the arm, and said to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>'Stay, listen a while, Thyrsis, for if my ears do not deceive
me, the sound that reaches them is that from the rebeck of
my good friend Elicio, on whom Nature bestowed so much
charm in many different arts, as you will hear if you listen
to him, and learn if you speak with him.'</p>

<p>'Think not, Damon,' replied Thyrsis, 'that I have yet to learn
Elicio's good qualities, for days ago fame clearly revealed them
to me. But be silent now, and let us listen to see if he sings
aught that may give us some sure token of his present fortune.'</p>

<p>'You say well,' answered Damon, 'but it will be necessary,
the better to hear him, for us to go in among these branches
so that we may listen to him more closely without being seen by
him.'</p>

<p>They did so, and placed themselves in so good a position that
no word that Elicio said or sang, failed to be heard by them
and even noted. Elicio was in the company of his friend
Erastro, from whom he was rarely separated by reason of the
pleasure and enjoyment he received from his excellent converse,
and all or most of the day was spent by them in
singing and playing their instruments, and at this moment,
Elicio playing his rebeck and Erastro his pipe, the former
began these verses:</p>

<p class="p01">The loving shepherd sang no more, nor did Thyrsis and
Damon wish to stay longer, but showing themselves unexpectedly
and with spirit, came to where Elicio was. When he saw them
he recognised his friend Damon, and going forward with
incredible joy to welcome him, said to him:</p>

<p>'What fortune, discreet Damon, has ordained that by your
presence you should bestow so fair a fortune on these banks
which have long wished for you?'</p>

<p>'It cannot be but fair,' answered Damon, 'since it has brought
me to see you, oh Elicio, a thing on which I set a value as great
as is the desire I had for it, and as long absence and the
friendship I cherish for you forced me to do. But if you
can for any reason say what you have said, it is because
you have before you the famous Thyrsis, glory and honour
of the Castilian soil.'</p>

<p>When Elicio heard him say that this was Thyrsis, to him only
known by fame, he welcomed him with great courtesy, and said
to him:</p>

<p>'Your pleasing countenance, renowned Thyrsis, agrees well
with what loud fame in lands near and far proclaims of your
worth and discretion: and so, seeing that your writings have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
filled me with wonder and led me to desire to know you and
serve you, you can henceforward count and treat me as a true
friend.'</p>

<p>'What I gain thereby,' replied Thyrsis, 'is so well known
that in vain would fame proclaim what the affection you bear
me makes you say that it proclaims of me, if I did not recognise
the favour you do me in seeking to place me in the number of your
friends; and since between those who are friends words of compliment
must be superfluous, let ours cease at this point, and let
deeds give witness of our good-will.'</p>

<p>'Mine will ever be to serve you,' replied Elicio, 'as you will
see, oh Thyrsis, if time or fortune place me in a position in any
way suitable for it; for that I now occupy, though I would not
change it for another offering greater advantages, is such that
it scarcely leaves me free to proffer what I desire.'</p>

<p>'Since you set your desire on so lofty a goal as you do,'
said Damon, 'I would hold it madness to endeavour to lower it
to an object that might be less; and so, friend Elicio, do not
speak ill of the condition in which you find yourself, for I assure
you that if it were compared with mine, I would find occasion to
feel towards you more envy than pity.'</p>

<p>'It is quite clear, Damon,' said Elicio, 'that you have been
away from these banks for many a day, since you do not
know what love makes me feel here, and if it is not so, you
cannot know or have experience of Galatea's disposition, for
if you had noted it, you would change into pity the envy you
might feel for me.'</p>

<p>'What new thing can he expect from Galatea's disposition,'
replied Damon, 'who has experienced that of Amaryllis?'</p>

<p>'If your stay on these banks,' answered Elicio, 'be as long as
I wish, you, Damon, will learn and see on them, and on others
will hear, how her cruelty and gentleness go in equal balance,
extremes which end the life of him whose misfortune has brought
him to the pass of adoring her.'</p>

<p>'On our Henares's banks,' said Thyrsis at this point, 'Galatea
had more fame for beauty than for cruelty; but above all, it is
said that she is discreet; and if this be true, as it ought to be, from
her discretion springs self-knowledge, and from self-knowledge
self-esteem, and from self-esteem desire not to stray, and from
desire not to stray comes desire not to gratify herself. And you,
Elicio, seeing how ill she responds to your wishes, give the name
of cruelty to that which you should have called honourable
reticence; and I do not wonder, for it is, after all, the
condition proper to lovers who find small favour.'</p>

<p>'You would be right in what you have said, oh Thyrsis,'
replied Elicio, 'if my desires were to wander from the path
befitting her honour and modesty; but if they are so measured,
as is due to her worth and reputation, what avails such disdain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
such bitter and peevish replies, such open withdrawal of the face
from him who has set all his glory on merely seeing it? Ah,
Thyrsis, Thyrsis, how love must have placed you on the summit
of its joys, since with so calm a spirit you speak of its effects!
I do not know that what you say now goes well with what
you once said when you sang:</p>


<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p>"Alas, from what a wealth of hope I come<br />
Unto a poor and faltering desire"&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">with the rest you added to it.'</p>

<p>Up to this point Erastro had been silent, watching what was
passing between the shepherds, wondering to see their gentle
grace and bearing, with the proofs each one gave of the great
discretion he had. But seeing that from step to step they had
been brought to reasoning on affairs of love, as one who was so
experienced in them, he broke silence, and said:</p>

<p>'I quite believe, discreet shepherds, that long experience
will have shown you that one cannot reduce to a fixed term
the disposition of loving hearts, which, being governed by
another's will, are exposed to a thousand contrary accidents.
And so, renowned Thyrsis, you have no reason to wonder at
what Elicio has said, and he as little to wonder at what you
say, or take for an example what he says you sang, still
less what I know you sang when you said:</p>

<p class="p1 center">"The pallor and the weakness I display,"</p>

<p>wherein you clearly showed the woeful plight in which you then
were; for a little later there came to our huts the news of your
bliss celebrated in those verses of yours, which are so famous.
They began, if I remember rightly:</p>

<p class="p1 center">"The dawn comes up, and from her fertile hand."</p>

<p>Whence we clearly see the difference there is between one
moment and another, and how love like them is wont to
change condition, making him laugh to-day who wept yesterday,
and him weep to-morrow who laughs to-day. And since I
have known her disposition so well, Galatea's harshness and
haughty disdain cannot succeed in destroying my hopes, though
I hope from her nothing save that she should be content that
I should love her.'</p>

<p>'He who should not hope a fair issue to so loving and
measured a desire as you have shown, oh shepherd,' replied
Damon, 'deserved renown beyond that of a despairing lover;
truly it is a great thing you seek of Galatea! But tell me,
shepherd&mdash;so may she grant it you&mdash;can it be that you have
your desire so well in bounds that it does not advance in
desire beyond what you have said.'</p>

<p>'You may well believe him, friend Damon,' said Elicio, 'since
Galatea's worth gives no opportunity for aught else to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
desired or hoped of her, and even this is so difficult to obtain
that at times in Erastro hope is chilled, and in me grows cold,
so that he counts as certain, and I as sure, that sooner must
death come than hope's fulfilment. But as it is not right
to welcome such honoured guests with the bitter tales of our
miseries, let them now cease, and let us betake ourselves to
the village, where you may rest from the heavy toil of the road,
and may with greater ease, if so you wish, learn our uneasiness.'</p>

<p>All were pleased to fall in with Elicio's wish, and he and
Erastro, collecting their flocks once more, though it was some
hours before the wonted time, in company with the two
shepherds, speaking on different matters, though all concerned
with love, journeyed towards the village. But, as all Erastro's
pastime was in playing and singing, so for this reason, as also
from the desire he had to learn if the two new shepherds were
as skilful as was said of them, in order to induce them and invite
them to do the same, he asked Elicio to play his rebeck, to the
sound of which he began to sing as follows:</p>

<p class="p01">E<small>RASTRO.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse ileft3">Before the light of yonder peaceful eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Whereby the sun is lit the earth to light,</div>
<div class="verse">My soul is so inflamed, that, in despite,</div>
<div class="verse">I fear that death will soon secure the prize.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">Yon clustered rays descending from the skies,</div>
<div class="verse">Sent by the Lord of Delos, are thus bright:</div>
<div class="verse">Such are the tresses of my heart's delight,</div>
<div class="verse">Whom, kneeling, I adore with litanies.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">Oh radiant light, ray of the radiant sun,</div>
<div class="verse">Nay sun in very truth, to thee I pray,</div>
<div class="verse">That thou wouldst let me love,&mdash;this boon alone.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">If jealous Heaven this boon to me deny,</div>
<div class="verse">Let me not die of grief though grief doth slay,</div>
<div class="verse">But grant, oh rays, that of a ray I die.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">The shepherds did not think ill of the sonnet, nor were they
displeased with Erastro's voice, which, though not one of the
most exquisite, was yet a tuneful one; and straightway Elicio,
moved by Erastro's example, bade him play his pipe, to the
sound of which he repeated this sonnet:</p>

<p class="p01">E<small>LICIO.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw30">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse ileft3">Alas! that to the lofty purpose, born</div>
<div class="verse">Within the fastness of my loving mind,</div>
<div class="verse">All are opposed, to wit, Heaven, fire and wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Water and earth, and she that doth me scorn!</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">They are my foes; 'twere better I should mourn</div>
<div class="verse">My rashness, and the enterprise begun</div>
<div class="verse">Abandon. But the impulse who can shun</div>
<div class="verse">Of ruthless fate, by Love's persistence torn?</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
<div class="verse ileft3">Though Heaven on high, though Love, though wind and fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Water and earth, and even my fair foe,</div>
<div class="verse">Each one, with might, and with my fate allied,</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">Should stay my bliss and scatter my desire,</div>
<div class="verse">My hope undoing,&mdash;yet, though hope should go,</div>
<div class="verse">I cannot cease to do what I have tried.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">As Elicio finished, straightway Damon, to the sound of the
same pipe of Erastro, began to sing in this wise:</p>

<p class="p01">D<small>AMON.</small></p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse ileft3">Softer than wax was I, when on my breast</div>
<div class="verse">I did imprint the image of the face</div>
<div class="verse">Of Amaryllis, cruel 'midst her grace,</div>
<div class="verse">Like to hard marble, or to savage beast.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">'Twas then Love set me in the loftiest</div>
<div class="verse">Sphere of his bliss, and bade sweet fortune come;</div>
<div class="verse">But now I fear that in the silent tomb</div>
<div class="verse">Alone shall my presumption find its rest.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">Of hope did Love, as vine of elm, take hold</div>
<div class="verse">Securely, and was climbing up with speed,</div>
<div class="verse">When moisture failed, and its ascent was stayed.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">'Twas not the moisture of mine eyes: of old</div>
<div class="verse">Their tribute ever&mdash;Fortune this doth heed&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Unto face, breast and earth, mine eyes have paid.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">Damon ceased, and Thyrsis, to the sound of the instruments
of the three shepherds, began to sing this sonnet:</p>

<div class="p01">T<small>HYRSIS.</small></div>



<div class="poetry-container pw30">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse ileft3">My faith broke through the net that death had spread;</div>
<div class="verse">To this pass have I come that I no more</div>
<div class="verse">Envy the highest and the richest store</div>
<div class="verse">Of happiness that man hath merited.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">I saw thee, and this bliss was straightway born,</div>
<div class="verse">Fair Phyllis, unto whom fate gave for dower</div>
<div class="verse">To turn to good that which was bad before,</div>
<div class="verse">And win to laughter him who once did mourn.</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">E'en as the felon, when he doth espy</div>
<div class="verse">The royal face, the rigour of the law</div>
<div class="verse">Escapes&mdash;this ordinance is true indeed&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse ileft3">E'en so doth death before thy presence fly,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh fairest of the fair, harm doth withdraw,</div>
<div class="verse">And leaveth life and fortune in its stead.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">As Thyrsis finished, all the instruments of the shepherds made
such pleasing music that it gave great joy to any who heard it,
being further aided from among the dense branches by a
thousand kinds of painted birds, which seemed as in chorus to
give them back reply with divine harmony. In this way they
had gone on a stretch, when they came to an ancient hermitage
standing on the slope of a hillock, not so far from the road but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
that they could hear the sound of a harp which some
one, it seemed, was playing within. Erastro, hearing this,
said:</p>

<p>'Stop, shepherds, for, as I think, we shall hear to-day what I
have wished to hear for days, namely, the voice of a graceful
youth, who, some twelve or fourteen days ago, came to spend
within yon hermitage a life harder than it seems to me his few
years can bear. Sometimes when I have passed this way, I
have heard a harp being played and a voice sounding, so sweet
that it has filled me with the keenest desire to listen to it; but
I have always come at the moment he stayed his song; and
though by speaking to him I have managed to become his
friend, offering to his service all within my means and power, I
have never been able to prevail with him to disclose to me who
he is, and the causes which have moved him to come so young
and settle in such solitude and retirement.'</p>

<p>What Erastro said about the young hermit, newly come there,
filled the shepherds with the same desire of knowing him as he
had; and so they agreed to approach the hermitage in such a
way that without being perceived they might be able to hear what
he sang, before they came to speak to him, and on doing this,
they succeeded so well that they placed themselves in a spot
where, without being seen or perceived, they heard him who
was within uttering to the sound of his harp, verses such as
these:</p>

<p class="p01">With a deep sigh, the secluded youth, who was within the
hermitage, ended his mournful song, and the shepherds, perceiving
that he was not going on, without more delay, went in
all together, and saw there, at one end, sitting on a hard stone,
a comely and graceful youth, apparently two and twenty years
of age, clad in a rough kersey, his feet unshod and his
body girt with a coarse rope, which served him as belt.
His head was drooping on one side, one hand clutched
the portion of the tunic over his heart, the other arm fell
limply on the other side. As they saw him in this plight,
and as he had made no movement on the entry of the
shepherds, they clearly recognised that he had fainted, as was
the truth, for his deep brooding over his sorrows often brought
him to such a pass. Erastro went up to him, and seizing him
roughly by the arm, made him come to himself, though so dazed
that he seemed to be waking from a heavy sleep; which tokens
of grief caused no small grief in those who witnessed it, and
straightway Erastro said to him:</p>

<p>'What is it, sir, that your troubled breast feels? Do not fail
to tell it, for you have before you those who will not refuse any
trouble to give relief to yours.'</p>

<p>'These are not the first offers you have made me,' replied the
young man with voice somewhat faint, 'nor yet would they be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
the last I would try to make use of, if I could; but fortune has
brought me to such a pass, that neither can they avail me, nor
can I do justice to them more than in will. This you can take
in return for the good you offer me; and if you wish to learn
aught else concerning me, time, which conceals nothing, will
tell you more than I could wish.'</p>

<p>'If you leave it to time to satisfy me in what you tell me,'
replied Erastro, 'to such payment small gratitude is due, since
time, in our despite, brings into the market-place the deepest
secret of our hearts.'</p>

<p>Thereupon the rest of the shepherds all asked him to tell
them the cause of his sorrow, especially Thyrsis, who, with
powerful arguments, persuaded him and gave him to understand,
that there is no evil in this life but brings with it its cure,
unless death, that interrupts man's course, opposes it. Thereto
he added other words, which moved the obstinate boy with his
to satisfy them all on what they wished to learn from him: and
so he said to them:</p>

<p>'Though for me it were better, my pleasant friends, to live the
little that remains to me of life without friendship, and to retire
to a greater solitude than that in which I am, yet, not to show
myself irresponsive to the good-will you have shown me, I
decide to tell you all that I think will be sufficient, and the
passes through which fickle fortune has brought me to the
strait in which I am. But as it seems to me that it is now somewhat
late, and that, as my misfortunes are many, it might be
possible for night to come on before I have told you them, it
will be well for us all to go to the village together, since it causes
me no further inconvenience to make the journey to-night I had
determined on to-morrow, which is compulsory for me, since
from your village I am provided with what I need for my sustenance;
and on the way, as best we can, I will inform you of
my adversities.'</p>

<p>All approved of what the young hermit said, and setting him
in their midst, they turned with loitering steps to follow the
road to the village; and straightway the sorrowing hermit, with
tokens of great grief, began in this wise the tale of his woes:</p>

<p>'In the ancient and famous city of Xeres, whose inhabitants
are favoured of Minerva and Mars, was born Timbrio, a valiant
knight, and if I had to relate his virtues and nobility of soul, I
would set myself a difficult task. It is enough to know that,
whether by his great goodness, or by the power of the stars
which drew me to it, I sought in every possible way to be his
particular friend; and in this Heaven was so kind to me, that
those who knew us, almost forgetting the name of Timbrio and
that of Silerio (which is mine) merely called us the two friends,
and we, by our constant converse and friendly deeds caused
this to be no idle opinion. In this wise we two passed our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
youthful years in incredible joy and happiness, engaging ourselves
now in the field in the pastime of the chase, now in the
city in that of honourable Mars, until, one day (of the many unlucky
days that hostile time has made me see in the course of my
life), there happened to my friend Timbrio a weighty quarrel
with a powerful knight, an inhabitant of the same city. The
dispute came to such a pass that the knight remained wounded
in his honour and Timbrio was obliged to absent himself, to
give an opportunity for the furious discord to cease, which was
beginning to kindle between the two families. He left a letter
written to his enemy, informing him that he would find him in
Italy, in the city of Milan or in Naples, whenever, as a knight,
he should wish to have satisfaction for the insult done him.
With this the factions between the kinsmen of both ceased:
and it was ordained that the offended knight, who was called
Pransiles, should challenge Timbrio to equal and mortal
combat, and that, on finding a safe field for the combat, he
should inform Timbrio. My luckless fate further ordained that,
at the time this happened, I should find myself so failing in
health, that I scarce could rise from my bed. And from this
chance, I lost that of following my friend wherever he might be
going, who, on parting, took his leave of me with no small discontent,
charging me, on recovering strength, to seek him, for
that I would find him in the city of Naples; and he left me with
greater pain than I can now express to you. But at the end of
a few days (the desire I had to see him prevailing on me more
than the weakness that wearied me), I set myself straightway
on the journey; and, in order that I might accomplish it with
more speed and safety, fortune offered me the convenience of
four galleys, which were lying ready equipped off the famous
isle of Cádiz for departure to Italy. I embarked on one of
them, and with a prosperous wind we soon discovered the
Catalán shores; and when we had cast anchor in a harbour
there, I, being somewhat weary of the sea, first making sure that
the galleys were not leaving there that night, disembarked with
only a friend and a servant of mine. I do not think it could
have been midnight, when the sailors and those that had the
galleys in charge, seeing that the serenity of the sky betokened
a calm, or a prosperous wind, so as not to lose the good
opportunity offered to them, at the second watch made the
signal for departure; and weighing anchor, with much speed
they set their oars to the smooth sea, and their sails to the
gentle wind, and it was done as I say with such haste, that
for all the haste I made to return to embark, I was not in
time. And so I had to remain on the shore with the
annoyance he can imagine, who has passed through ordinary
occurrences of the kind, for I was badly supplied with everything
that was necessary to continue my journey by land.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
But, reflecting that little remedy was to be hoped from
remaining there, I determined to return to Barcelona, where,
as being a larger city, it might be possible to find someone
to supply me with what I needed, writing to Xeres or
Seville as regards the payment. The morning broke on me,
whilst engaged in these thoughts, and, determined to put
them into practice, I waited till the day should be more
advanced; and when on the point of departing, I perceived
a great sound on land, and all the people running to the
principal street of the place. And when I asked some one
what it was, he replied to me: "Go, sir, to that corner, where
you will learn what you want from the voice of the crier." I
did so, and the first object on which I set eyes was a lofty
crucifix, and a great mob of people, signs that some one
condemned to death was coming among them; and all this
was proved to me by the voice of the crier, declaring that
justice ordered a man to be hanged for having been a robber
and a highwayman. When the man came to me, I straightway
recognised that he was my good friend Timbrio, coming on
foot with fetters on his hands, and a rope round his throat,
his eyes riveted on the crucifix he carried before him. He
was speaking and protesting to the priests who were going
with him, that, by the account he thought, within a few short
hours, to render to the true God, whose image he had before
his eyes, he had never, in all the course of his life, committed
aught for which he deserved to suffer publicly so shameful a
death; and he asked all to ask the judges to give him some
term, to prove how innocent he was of that which they
accused him of. Let it here be imagined, if imagination could
raise itself so high, how I would remain at the terrible sight
offered to my eyes. I know not what to say to you, gentlemen,
save that I remained so amazed and beside myself, and
so bereft of all my senses, that I must have seemed a marble
statue to anyone who saw me at that moment. But now
that the confused murmur of the people, the raised voices of
the criers, the piteous words of Timbrio, and the consolatory
words of the priests, and the undoubted recognition of my
good friend, had brought me from my first amazement, and
the seething blood came to give aid to my fainting heart,
awakening in it the wrath befitting the crying vengeance for
Timbrio's wrong, without regarding the danger I incurred,
but only that of Timbrio, to see if I could set him free or
follow him to the life beyond, fearing but little to lose mine,
I laid hand on my sword; and, with more than ordinary fury,
forced my way through the confused crowd, till I came to where
Timbrio was. He, not knowing if so many swords had been
unsheathed on his behalf, was watching what was going on
with perplexed and anguished mind, until I said to him:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
"Where, Timbrio, is the strength of your valorous breast?
What do you hope, or what do you wait for? Why not avail
yourself of the present opportunity? seek, true friend, to save
your life whilst mine forms a shield against the injustice,
which I think is being done you here." These words of
mine and Timbrio's recognition of me caused him to forget all
fear and to break the bonds or fetters from his hands; but all
his ardour would have availed little, had not the priests, moved
with compassion, aided his wish. These seized him bodily, and
despite those who sought to hinder it, entered with him into a
church hard by, leaving me in the midst of all the officers of
justice, who with great persistence endeavoured to seize me, as
at last they did, since my strength alone was not capable of
resisting so many strengths combined; and with more violence
than in my opinion my offence deserved, they took me to the
public gaol, wounded with two wounds. My boldness and the
fact that Timbrio had escaped increased my fault, and the
judges' anger; they, weighing carefully the crime committed by
me, deeming it just that I should die, straightway pronounced
the cruel sentence and awaited another day to execute it. This
sad news came to Timbrio there in the church where he was,
and as I afterwards learned, my sentence caused him more
emotion than his own death-sentence had done; and to free
me from it, he again offered to surrender himself once more
to the power of the law; but the priests advised him that that
was of little avail, nay rather, was adding evil to evil and misfortune
to misfortune, since his surrender would not bring about
my release, for that it could not take place without my being
punished for the fault committed. Not a few arguments were
needed to persuade Timbrio not to give himself up to justice;
but he calmed himself by deciding in his mind to do for me
next day what I had done for him, in order to pay me in the
same coin or die in the attempt. I was informed of all his
intentions by a priest who came to confess me, through whom I
sent him word that the best remedy my calamity could have was
that he should escape and seek with all speed to inform the
viceroy of Barcelona of all that had happened, before the judges
of that place should execute judgment on him. I also learned
the reason why my friend Timbrio was consigned to bitter
punishment, as the same priest I have mentioned to you told
me; it was that, as Timbrio came journeying through the kingdom
of Catalonia, on leaving Perpignan, he fell in with a number
of brigands, who had as lord and chief a valiant Catalán gentleman,
who by reason of certain enmities was in the band&mdash;as it
is the time-honoured custom of that kingdom for those who have
suffered from an enemy, whenever they are persons of mark, to
join one, and to inflict all the evil they can, not only on lives, but
on property, a practice opposed to all Christianity, and worthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
of all commiseration. It happened then that while the brigands
were busied in robbing Timbrio of what he had with him, that
moment their lord and captain came up, and as after all he was
a gentleman, he did not wish that any wrong should be done to
Timbrio before his eyes; but rather, deeming him a man of
worth and talents, he made him a thousand courteous offers,
asking him to remain with him that night in a place near by, for
that on the morrow he would give him a safe-conduct so that
without any fear he might pursue his journey until he left that
province. Timbrio could not but do what the courteous gentleman
asked of him, constrained by the good offices received from
him; they went off together and came to a little spot where
they were joyously received by the people of the place. But
fortune, which up till then had jested with Timbrio, ordained
that that same night a company of soldiers, gathered together for
this very purpose, should fall in with the brigands: and having
surprised them, they easily routed them. And though they
could not seize the captain, they seized and killed many others,
and one of the prisoners was Timbrio, whom they took for a
notorious robber in that band, and as you may imagine, he must
undoubtedly have much resembled him, since, though the other
prisoners testified that he was not the man they thought, telling
the truth about all that had happened, yet malice had such
power in the breasts of the judges that without further inquiry
they sentenced him to death. And this would have been carried
out, had not Heaven, that favours just purposes, ordained that the
galleys should depart, and I remain on land to do what I have
so far been telling you I did. Timbrio was in the church, and I
in gaol, arranging that he should set out that night for Barcelona,
and while I was waiting to see where the rage of the offended
judges would end, Timbrio and I were freed from our
misfortune amidst another yet greater that befell them. But
would that Heaven had been kind and wreaked on me alone the
fury of its wrath, if but it had been averted from that poor unfortunate
people who placed their wretched necks beneath the
edges of a thousand barbarous swords. It would be a little more
than midnight, an hour suited for wicked onslaughts, at which
the wearied world is wont to yield its wearied limbs to the arms
of sweet sleep, when suddenly there arose among all the people
a confused hubbub of voices crying: "To arms, to arms, the
Turks are in the land." The echoes of these sad cries&mdash;who
doubts but that they caused terror in the breasts of the women
and even set consternation in the brave hearts of the men? I
know not what to say to you, sirs, save that in an instant the
wretched land began to burn so greedily that the very stones
with which the houses were built seemed but to offer fitting fuel
to the kindled fire that was consuming all. By the light of the
raging flames the barbarous scimetars were seen flashing and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
white turbans appearing of the Turks, who, all aflame, were
breaking down the doors of the houses with axes or hatchets of
hard steel, and entering therein, were coming out laden with
Christian spoils. One carried the wearied mother, another the
tender little son, who with faint and weak groans pleaded, the
mother for her son, and the son for his mother; and one I know
there was who with profane hand stayed the fulfilment of the
rightful desire of the chaste maiden newly-wed and of the hapless
husband, before whose weeping eyes mayhap he saw culled
the fruit the ill-starred one was thinking in a short time to enjoy.
So great was the confusion, so many the cries and minglings of
these different voices that they caused much terror. The
savage and devilish rabble, seeing what little resistance was
made them, dared to enter the hallowed temples, and lay infidel
hands on the holy relics, placing in their bosoms the gold with
which they were adorned, and dashing them to the ground with
loathsome contempt. Little availed the priest his holiness, the
friar his refuge, the old man his snowy hair, the boy his gallant
youth, or the little child his simple innocence, for from all those
unbelieving dogs carried off booty. They, after burning the
houses, robbing the temple, deflowering the maidens, and slaying
the defenders, at the time the dawn was coming, more wearied
than sated with what they had done, returned without any
hindrance to their vessels, having already loaded them with
all the best the village contained, leaving it desolate and without
inhabitant, for they were taking with them nearly all the
people and the rest had taken refuge in the mountain. Who at
so sad a sight could have kept his hands still and his eyes dry?
But, ah! our life is so full of woes that, for all the mournful
disaster I have related to you, there were Christian hearts that
rejoiced, even those of the men in the gaol who, amidst the
general unhappiness, recovered their own happiness, for, pretending
to go and defend the village, they broke the gates of the
prison, and set themselves free, each one seeking not to attack
the enemy, but to save himself, and amongst them I enjoyed the
freedom so dearly gained. And seeing there was no one to face
the enemy, through fear of falling into their clutches, or returning
to the clutches of the prison, forsaking the wasted village,
with no small pain at what I had seen, and with that caused by
my wounds, I followed a man who told me he would bring me
safely to a monastery which was in those mountains, where I
would be cured of my hurts and even defended, if they sought
to seize me again. In a word I followed him, as I have told you,
in the desire to learn what my friend Timbrio's fortune had
wrought; he, as I afterwards learned, had escaped with some
wounds, and followed over the mountain another road different
from that I took; he stopped at the port of Rosas, where he
remained some days, seeking to learn what fate had been mine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
and at last, not learning any news, he went away in a ship and
came with a favouring wind to the great city of Naples. I
returned to Barcelona, and there furnished myself with what I
needed; and then, being healed of my wounds, I resumed
my journey, and, no misadventure happening to me, came to
Naples, where I found Timbrio ill; and such was the joy we
both felt at seeing each other, that I have not the power to
describe it properly to you now. There we told each other
of our lives, and of all that had happened to us up to that
moment; but this my pleasure was all watered by seeing
Timbrio not so well as I could wish, nay rather so ill, and with
so strange a disease, that if I had not come at that moment, I
might have come in time to perform the rites of his death, and
not to celebrate the joys of seeing him. After he had learnt
from me all he wanted, with tears in his eyes he said to me:
"Ah, friend Silerio! I truly think that Heaven seeks to add to the
load of my misfortunes, so that, by giving me health through
your safety, I may remain every day under greater obligation
to serve you." These words of Timbrio's moved me; but, as
they seemed to me courtesies so little used between us, they
filled me with wonder. And not to weary you in telling you
word for word what I replied to him, and what he answered
further, I shall only tell you that Timbrio, unhappy man, was
in love with a notable lady of that city, whose parents were
Spaniards, though she had been born in Naples. Her name
was Nisida, and her beauty so great, that I make bold to say
that nature summed up in her its highest perfections; and in her
modesty and beauty were so united, that what the one enflamed
the other chilled, and the desires her grace raised to the loftiest
heaven, her modest propriety brought down to the lowest depths
of earth. From this cause Timbrio was as poor in hope as rich
in thoughts; and above all failing in health, and in the plight of
ending his days without disclosing his state&mdash;such was the fear
and reverence he had conceived for the fair Nisida. But after I
had fully learnt his disease, and had seen Nisida, and considered
the quality and nobility of her parents, I determined to waive for
him property, life and honour, and more, if more I had in my
power to bestow. And so I employed an artifice, the strangest
heard or read of up till now; which was, that I decided to dress
up as a buffoon, and with a guitar to enter Nisida's house, which,
as her parents were, as I have said, among the principal people
of the city, was frequented by many other buffoons. This
decision seemed good to Timbrio, and straightway he left to the
hands of my skill all his happiness. Forthwith I had several
elegant costumes made, of various kinds, and, putting them on,
I began to rehearse my new character before Timbrio, who
laughed not a little at seeing me thus clothed in buffoon's garb;
and to see if my skill equalled the dress, he told me to say some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>thing
to him, pretending that he was a great prince, and I newly
come to visit him. And if memory does not fail me, and you,
sirs, are not tired of listening to me, I will tell you what I sang
to him then, as it was the first time.'</p>

<p>All said that nothing would give them greater pleasure, than
to learn in detail all the issue of his affair, and so they bade
him not to fail to tell them anything, however trivial it might be.</p>

<p>'Since you give me this permission,' said the hermit, 'I have
no desire to fail to tell you how I began to give examples of my
foolery, for it was with these verses that I sang to Timbrio,
imagining him to be a great lord to whom I was saying
them:</p>

<p class="p01">'These and other things of more jest and laughter I then sang
to Timbrio, seeking to adapt the spirit and bearing of my body,
so that I might in every way show myself a practised buffoon:
and so well did I get on in the part, that in a few days I was
known by all the chief people in the city, and the fame of the
Spanish buffoon flew through it all, until at last they desired to
see me in the house of Nisida's father, which desire I would have
fulfilled for them with much readiness, if I had not purposely
waited to be asked. But at length I could not excuse myself
from going there one day when they had a banquet, where I
saw more closely the just cause Timbrio had for suffering, and
that which Heaven gave me to rob me of happiness all the days
I shall remain in this life. I saw Nisida, Nisida I saw, that I
might see no more, nor is there more to see after having seen
her. Oh mighty power of love, against which our mighty
powers avail but little! can it be that in an instant, in a moment,
thou shouldst bring the props and armaments of my loyalty to
such a pass, as to level them all with the ground! Ah, if only
the thought of who I was had stayed with me a little for aid,
the friendship I owed to Timbrio, Nisida's great worth, and the
ignominious costume in which I found myself, which all hindered
the hope of winning her (the staff wherewith love, in the
beginnings of love, advances or retires) from springing up
together with the new and loving desire that had sprung up in
me. In a word I saw the beauty I have told you, and since to
see her was of such moment to me, I sought ever to win the
friendship of her parents, and of all her household; and
this by playing the wit and the man of breeding, playing
my part with the greatest discretion and grace in my power.
And when a gentleman who was at table that day asked
me to sing something in praise of Nisida's beauty, fortune
willed that I should call to mind some verses, which I had
made, many days before, for another all but similar occasion;
and adopting them for the present one, I repeated them to
this effect:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">'With these and other things that I then sang, all were so
charmed with me, and especially Nisida's parents, that they
offered me all I might need, and asked me to let no day go by
without visiting them; and so, without my purpose being discovered
or imagined, I came to achieve my first design, which was
to expedite my entrance into the house of Nisida, who enjoyed
extremely my bright ways. But now that the lapse of many
days, and my frequent converse and the great friendship
all that household showed me, had removed some shadows
from the excessive fear I felt at disclosing my intent to Nisida,
I determined to see how far went the fortune of Timbrio, whose
only hope for it lay in my solicitude. But woe is me! I was
then more ready to ask a salve for my wound than health for
another's; for Nisida's grace, beauty, discretion, and modesty
had so wrought in my soul that it was placed in no less an extreme
of grief and love than that of hapless Timbrio. To your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
discreet imagination I leave it to picture what a heart could
feel in which there fought, on the one hand, the laws of friendship,
and, on the other, the inviolable laws of Cupid; for, if
those obliged it not to go beyond what they and reason asked of
it, these constrained it to set store by what was due to its
happiness. These attacks and struggles afflicted me in such
wise that, without procuring another's health I began to have
fears for my own, and to grow so weak and pale that I caused
general compassion in all that saw me, and those who showed
it most were Nisida's parents; and even she herself, with pure
and Christian sympathy, often asked me to tell her the cause of
my disease, offering me all that was necessary for its cure.
"Ah!" would I say to myself whenever Nisida made me such
offers, "with what ease, fair Nisida, could your hand cure the
evil your beauty has wrought! but I boast myself so good a
friend that, though I counted my cure as certain as I count it
impossible and uncertain, it would be impossible for me to
accept it." And since these thoughts at such moments disturbed
my fancy, I did not succeed in making any reply to Nisida;
whereat she and a sister of hers, who was called Blanca (less
in years, though not less in discretion and beauty than Nisida),
were amazed, and with increasing desire to know the origin
of my sadness, with many importunities asked me to conceal
from them nought of my grief. Seeing, then, that fortune
offered me the opportunity of putting into practice what my
cunning had brought so far, once, when by chance the fair Nisida
and her sister found themselves alone, and returned anew to
ask what they had asked so often, I said to them: "Think not,
ladies, that the silence I have up till now kept in not telling you
the cause of the pain you imagine I feel has been caused by my
small desire to obey you, since it is very clear that if my lowly
state has any happiness in this life, it is to have thereby
succeeded in coming to know you, and to serve you as retainer.
The only cause has been the thought that, though I reveal it, it
will not serve for more than to give you grief, seeing how far away
is its cure. But now that it is forced upon me to satisfy you in
this, you must know, ladies, that in this city is a gentleman,
a native of my own country, whom I hold as master, refuge, and
friend, the most generous, discreet, and courtly man that may
be found far and wide. He is here, away from his dear native
land, by reason of certain quarrels which befell him there and
forced him to come to this city, believing that, if there in his
own land he left enemies, here in a foreign land friends would
not fail him. But his belief has turned out so mistaken that
one enemy alone, whom, without knowing how, he has made
here for himself, has placed him in such a pass that if Heaven
do not help him he will end his friendships and enmities by
ending his life. And as I know the worth of Timbrio (for this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
is the name of the gentleman whose misfortune I am relating to
you), and know what the world will lose in losing him and
what I shall lose if I lose him, I give the tokens of feeling you
have seen, and even they are small compared to what the danger
in which Timbrio is placed ought to move me to. I know well
that you will desire to know, ladies, who is the enemy who has
placed so valorous a gentleman as he whom I have depicted to
you in such a pass; but I also know that, in naming him to
you, you will not wonder save that he has not yet destroyed
him and slain him. His enemy is love, the universal destroyer
of our peace and prosperity; this fierce enemy took possession
of his heart. On entering this city Timbrio beheld a fair lady
of singular worth and beauty, but so high placed and so modest
that the hapless one has never dared to reveal to her his
thought." To this point had I come when Nisida said to me:
"Truly, Astor," for this was my name for the nonce, "I know not
if I can believe that that gentleman is as valorous and discreet
as you say, since he has allowed himself so easily to surrender
to an evil desire so newly born, yielding himself so needlessly
to the arms of despair; and though I understand but little
these effects of love, yet it seems to me that it is folly and
weakness for him who is cast down by them to fail to reveal his
thoughts to her who inspires it in him, though she be of all the
worth conceivable. For what shame can result to her from
knowing that she is well loved, or to him what greater evil from
her harsh and petulant reply than the death he himself brings
on himself by being silent? It would not be right that
because a judge has a reputation for sternness, anyone should
fail to allege proof of his claim. But let us suppose that the
death take place of a lover as silent and timid as that friend of
yours; tell me, would you call the lady with whom he was in
love cruel? No indeed, for one can scarcely relieve the need
which does not come to one's knowledge, nor does it fall within
one's duty to seek to learn it so as to relieve it. So, forgive me,
Astor, but the deeds of that friend of yours do not make very
true the praises you give him." When I heard such words
from Nisida, straightway I could have wished by mine to reveal
to her all the secret of my breast, but, as I understood the
goodness and simplicity with which she expressed them, I had
to check myself, waiting for a better and more private opportunity,
and thus I replied to her: "When the affairs of love,
fair Nisida, are regarded with free eyes, follies so great are seen
in them that they are no less worthy of laughter than of pity:
but if the soul finds itself entangled in love's subtle net, then the
feelings are so fettered and so beside their wonted selves, that
memory merely serves as treasurer and guardian of the object the
eyes have regarded, the understanding is of use only in searching
into and learning the worth of her whom it loves well, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
will in consenting that the memory and understanding should
not busy themselves with aught else: and so the eyes see like a
silvered mirror, for they make everything larger. Now hope
increases when they are favoured, now fear when they are cast
down; and thus what has happened to Timbrio, happens to
many, that deeming at first very high the object to which their
eyes were raised, they lose the hope of attaining it, but not in
such wise that love does not say to them there within the soul:
Who knows? it might be; and thereat hope goes, as the saying
is, between two waters, while if it should forsake them altogether,
love would flee with it. And hence it arises that the heart of
the afflicted lover walks between fearing and daring, and without
venturing to tell it, he braces himself up, and presses together
his wound, hoping, though he knows not from whom, for the
remedy from which he sees himself so far away. In this very
plight I have found Timbrio, though, in spite of all, he has, at
my persuasion, written to the lady for whom he is dying, a
letter which he gave to me that I might give it to her and see if
there appeared in it anything in any way unseemly, so that
I might correct it. He charged me also to seek the means of
placing it in his lady's hands, which, I think, will be impossible,
not because I will not hazard it, since the least I will hazard to
serve him will be life, but because it seems to me that I shall
not find an opportunity to give it." "Let us see it," said
Nisida, "for I wish to see how discreet lovers write." Straightway
I drew from my bosom a letter which had been written
some days before, in the hope of an opportunity for Nisida to
see it, and fortune offering to me this one, I showed it to her.
As I had read it many times, it remained in my memory, and
its words were these:</p>


<p class="center p1">T<small>IMBRIO TO</small> N<small>ISIDA.</small></p>

<p>"I had determined, fair lady, that my ill-starred end might
declare to you who I was, since it seemed to me better that you
should praise my silence in death than blame my boldness in
life; but as I think it befits my soul to leave this world in
favour with you, so that in the next love may not deny it the
reward for what it has suffered, I make you cognisant of the
state in which your rare beauty has placed me. It is such that,
though I could indicate it, I would not obtain its cure, since for
small things no one should make bold to offend your exalted
worth, whereby, and by your honourable generosity I hope to
renew life to serve you, or to win death to offend you never
more."</p>

<p>'Nisida was listening with much attention to this letter,
and, when she had heard it all, said: "The lady to whom this
letter is sent has naught to complain of, unless, from pure
pride, she has become prudish, a failing from which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
greater part of the ladies in this city are not free. But
nevertheless, Astor, do not fail to give it to her, since, as
I have already told you, more evil cannot be expected from
her reply, than that the evil you say your friend suffers
now should become worse. And to encourage you the more,
I wish to assure you that there is no woman so coy and
so on the alert to watch over her honour that it grieves
her much to see and learn that she is loved, for then she
knows that the opinion she holds of herself is not vain,
while it would be the contrary if she saw she was wooed
by none." "I know well, lady, that what you say is true,"
I replied, "but I am afraid that, if I make bold to give it,
it must at least cost me the refusal of admittance henceforward
into that house, whereat there would come to me
no less hurt than to Timbrio." "Seek not, Astor," replied
Nisida, "to confirm the sentence which the judge has not
yet given. Be of good courage, for this on which you
venture is no fierce conflict." "Would to Heaven, fair
Nisida," I answered, "that I saw myself in that pass, for
more readily would I offer my breast to the danger and
fierceness of a thousand opposing arms than my hand to
give this loving letter to her who, I fear, being offended
by it, must hurl upon my shoulders the punishment another's
fault deserves. But, in spite of these objections, I intend
to follow, lady, the counsel you have given me, though I
shall wait for a time when fear shall not occupy my feelings
as much as now. Meanwhile I entreat you to pretend that
you are the one to whom this letter is sent, and give me
some reply to take to Timbrio, in order that by this deceit
he may be comforted a little, and time and opportunities
may reveal to me what I am to do." "A poor artifice you
would employ," answered Nisida, "for, granted that I were
now to give, in another's name, some soft or disdainful
reply, do you not see that time, that discloses our ends,
will clear up the deceit, and Timbrio will be more angry
with you than satisfied? Especially as since I have not
hitherto replied to such letters, I would not wish to
begin by giving replies in a feigned and lying manner;
but, though I know I am going contrary to what I owe
to myself, if you promise to tell me who the lady is, I
will tell you what to say to your friend, and such words
that he will be pleased for the nonce, and even though
afterwards things turn out contrary to what he thinks, the
lie will not be found out thereby." "Do not ask this of me,
Nisida," I answered, "for to tell you her name places me in
confusion as great as I would be placed in if I gave her
the letter. Suffice it to know that she is of high degree,
and that, without doing you any detriment, she is not inferior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
to you in beauty, and saying this, it seems to me, I praise
her more than all women born." "I am not surprised that
you say this of me," said Nisida, "since, with men of your
condition and calling, to flatter is their business; but,
leaving all this on one side, as I do not wish you to lose
the comfort of so good a friend, I advise you to tell
him that you went to give the letter to his lady, and
that you have held with her all the discourses you have
held with me, without omitting anything, and how she read
your letter, and the encouragement she gave you to take it
to his lady, thinking she was not the one to whom it came,
and that, though you did not make bold to declare everything,
you have come to this conclusion from her words
that, when she learns she is the one for whom the letter
came, the deceit and the undeceiving will not cause her
much pain. In this way he will receive some solace in
his trouble, and afterwards, on revealing your intention
to his lady, you can reply to Timbrio what she replies
to you, since, up to the moment she knows it, this lie
remains in force, and the truth of what may follow,
without to-day's deceit interfering." I was left marvelling
at Nisida's discreet project, and indeed not without mistrust
of the honesty of my own artifice; and so, kissing her
hands for the good counsel, and agreeing with her that I
was to give her a particular account of whatever happened in
this affair, I went and told Timbrio all that had happened
to me with Nisida. Thence came it that hope came into
his soul and turned anew to sustain him, banishing
from his heart the clouds of chilly fear that up till then
had kept him in gloom; and all this pleasure was increased
by my promising him at every step that my
steps should only be devoted to his service, and that when
next I found myself with Nisida, he should win the game
of skill with as fair a success as his thoughts deserved.
One thing I have forgotten to tell you, that all the time
I was talking with Nisida and her sister, the younger sister
never spoke a word, but with a strange silence ever hung
on mine; and I can tell you, sirs, that, if she was silent,
it was not because she could not speak with all discretion
and grace, for in these two sisters nature showed all she
has in her power to bestow. Nevertheless, I know not if
I should tell you that I would that Heaven had denied me
the happiness of having known them, especially Nisida,
the beginning and end of all my misfortune; but what
can I do, if that which the fates have ordained cannot be
stayed by human means? I loved, love, and shall love
Nisida well, yet without hurt to Timbrio, as my wearied
tongue has well shown, for I never spoke to her, but it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
was on Timbrio's behalf, ever concealing, with more than
ordinary discretion, my own pain, so as to cure another's.
It happened then, that as Nisida's beauty was so engraven
on my soul from the first moment my eyes beheld her,
being unable to keep so rich a treasure concealed in my
breast, whenever I found myself at times alone or apart,
I used to reveal it in some loving and mournful songs
under the veil of a feigned name. And so one night,
thinking that neither Timbrio nor anyone else was listening
to me, to comfort somewhat my wearied spirit, in a retired
apartment, to the accompaniment only of a lute, I sang some
verses, which, as they placed me in the direst turmoil, I shall
have to repeat to you. They were as follows:</p>

<p class="p01">'It resulted from my being so transported in my endless
imaginings that I did not take heed to sing these verses I have
repeated, in a voice as low as I ought, nor was the place where
I was so secret as to prevent their being listened to by Timbrio;
and when he heard them, it came into his mind that mine was
not free from love, and that if I felt any, it was for Nisida, as
could be gathered from my song; and though he discovered the
true state of my thoughts, he did not discover that of my wishes,
but rather understanding them to be contrary to what I did think,
he decided to depart that very night and go to where he might
be found by nobody, only to leave me the opportunity of alone
serving Nisida. All this I learnt from a page of his, who was
acquainted with all his secrets, who came to me in great distress
and said to me: "Help, Señor Silerio, for Timbrio, my master
and your friend, wishes to leave us and go away this night.
He has not told me where, but only that I should get for him I
do not know how much money, and that I should tell no one he
is going, especially telling me not to tell you: and this thought
came to him after he had been listening to some verse or other
you were singing just now. To judge from the excessive grief
I have seen him display, I think he is on the verge of despair;
and as it seems to me that I ought rather to assist in his cure
than to obey his command, I come to tell it to you, as to one
who can intervene to prevent him putting into practice so
fatal a purpose." With strange dread I listened to what
the page told me, and went straightway to see Timbrio in his
apartment, and, before I went in, I stopped to see what he was
doing. He was stretched on his bed, face downwards, shedding
countless tears accompanied by deep sighs, and with a low voice
and broken words, it seemed to me that he was saying this:
"Seek, my true friend Silerio, to win the fruit your solicitude
and toil has well deserved, and do not seek, by what you think you
owe to friendship for me, to fail to gratify your desire, for I will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
restrain mine, though it be with the extreme means of death;
for, since you freed me from it, when with such love and fortitude
you offered yourself to the fierceness of a thousand swords,
it is not much that I should now repay you in part for so good a
deed by giving you the opportunity to enjoy her in whom Heaven
summed up all its beauty, and love set all my happiness, without
the hindrance my presence can cause you. One thing only
grieves me, sweet friend, and it is that I cannot bid you farewell
at this bitter parting, but accept for excuse that you are the
cause of it. Oh, Nisida, Nisida! how true is it of your beauty,
that he who dares to look upon it must needs atone for his fault
by the penalty of dying for it! Silerio saw it, and if he had
not been so struck with it as I believe he has been, he would
have lost with me much of the reputation he had for discretion.
But since my fortune has so willed it, let Heaven know that
I am no less Silerio's friend than he is mine; and, as tokens of
this truth, let Timbrio part himself from his glory, exile himself
from his bliss, and go wandering from land to land, away from
Silerio and Nisida, the two true and better halves of his soul."
And straightway, with much passion, he rose from the bed,
opened the door, and finding me there said to me: "What do
you want, friend, at such an hour? Is there perchance any news?"
"Such news there is," I answered him, "that I had not been sorry
though it were less." In a word, not to weary you, I got so far
with him, that I persuaded him and gave him to understand
that his fancy was false, not as to the fact of my being in love,
but as to the person with whom, for it was not with Nisida, but
with her sister Blanca; and I knew how to tell him this in such
a way that he counted it true. And that he might credit it the
more, memory offered me some stanzas which I myself had made
many days before, to another lady of the same name, which I
told him I had composed for Nisida's sister. And they were so
much to the purpose, that though it be outside the purpose to
repeat them now, I cannot pass them by in silence. They were
these:</p>

<p>Silerio would have gone further with his story, had he not
been stopped by the sound of many pipes and attuned flageolets,
which was heard at their backs; and, turning their heads, they
saw coming towards them about a dozen gay shepherds, set in
two lines, and in the midst came a comely herdsman, crowned
with a garland of honeysuckle and other different flowers. He
carried a staff in one hand; and with staid step advanced little
by little, and the other shepherds, with the same success,
all playing their instruments, gave pleasing and rare token
of themselves. As soon as Elicio saw them, he recognised that
Daranio was the shepherd they brought in the midst, and that
the others were all neighbours, who wished to be present at his
wedding, to which also Thyrsis and Damon had come; and to
gladden the betrothal feast, and to honour the bridegroom, they
were proceeding in that manner towards the village. But Thyrsis,
seeing that their coming had imposed silence upon Silerio's
story, asked him to spend that night together with them all
in the village, where he would be waited upon with all the
good-will possible, and might satisfy their wishes by finishing
the incident he had begun. Silerio promised this, and at the
same moment came up the band of joyous shepherds, who,
recognising Elicio, and Daranio Thyrsis and Damon, his
friends, welcomed one another with tokens of great joy;
and renewing the music, and renewing their happiness, they
turned to pursue the road they had begun. Now that
they were coming nigh to the village, there came to their
ears the sound of the pipe of the unloving Lenio, whereat
they all received no little pleasure, for they already knew his
extreme disposition, and so, when Lenio saw and knew them,
without interrupting his sweet song, he came towards them singing
as follows:</p>

<p class="p01">As Lenio ceased singing, he was courteously received by all
the shepherds, and when he heard them name Damon and
Thyrsis, whom he only knew by repute, he was astonished at
seeing their admirable bearing, and so he said to them:</p>

<p>'What encomiums would suffice, though they were the best
that could be found in eloquence, to have the power of exalting
and applauding your worth, famous shepherds, if perchance
love's follies were not mingled with the truths of your renowned
writings? But since you are in love's decline, a disease to all
appearance incurable, though my rude talents may pay you
your due in valuing and praising your rare discretion, it will be
impossible for me to avoid blaming your thoughts.'</p>

<p>'If you had yours, discreet Lenio,' replied Thyrsis, 'without
the shadows of the idle opinion which fills them, you would
straightway see the brightness of ours, and that they deserve
more glory and praise for being loving, than for any subtlety or
discretion they might contain.'</p>

<p>'No more, Thyrsis, no more,' replied Lenio, 'for I know well
that with such great and such obstinate foes my reasonings will
have little force.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>'If they had force,' answered Elicio, 'those who are here are
such friends of truth, that not even in jest would they contradict
it, and herein you can see, Lenio, how far you go from it, since
there is no one to approve your words, or even to hold your
intentions good.'</p>

<p>'Then in faith,' said Lenio, 'may your intentions not save you,
oh Elicio, but let the air tell it, which you ever increase with
sighs, and the grass of these meadows which grows with your
tears, and the verses you sang the other day and wrote on the
beeches of this wood, for in them will be seen what it is you
praise in yourself and blame in me.'</p>

<p>Lenio would not have remained without a reply, had they not
seen coming to where they were the fair Galatea, with the discreet
shepherdesses Florisa and Teolinda, who, not to be recognised
by Damon and Thyrsis, had placed a white veil before her fair
face. They came and were received by the shepherds with
joyous welcome, especially by the lovers Elicio and Erastro,
who felt such strange content at the sight of Galatea, that
Erastro, being unable to conceal it, in token thereof, without any
one asking it of him, beckoned to Elicio to play his pipe, to the
sound of which, with joyous and sweet accents, he sang the
following verses:</p>

<p class="p01">E<small>RASTRO.</small></p>

<p class="p01">Here Erastro ended his song, and the way was ended of
going to the village, where Thyrsis, Damon and Silerio repaired
to Elicio's house, so that the opportunity might not be lost of
learning the end of the story of Silerio, which he had begun.
The fair shepherdesses, Galatea and Florisa, offering to be
present on the coming day at Daranio's wedding, left the
shepherds, and all or most remained with the bridegroom,
whilst the girls went to their houses. And that same night,
Silerio, being urged by his friend Erastro, and by the desire
which wearied him to return to his hermitage, ended the sequel
of his story, as will be seen in the following book.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_115" href="#FNanchor_115" class="label">[115]</a> Juan de Espera en Dios is supposed originally to have been a popular name for

An exceedingly doleful jest (in four volumes) was published at the end of the
eighteenth century under the title of <cite>Zumbas con que el famoso Juan de
Espera en Dios, hijo de Millan, y sobrino de Juan de Buen Alma, acude á
dar vayas, bregas y chascas con los alegres gracejos y salados períodos de
la divertida série de su graciosa vida á la melancolía y sus macilentos
contertulios en los desvanes de los desagrados aprehensivos donde intentan
anidarse; las que traducidas del Español al Castellano irá dando á luz el
Jueves de cada semana Don Joseph de Santos Capuano, según se las deparó
la feliz casualidad á su hermano Don Santiago, y este se las raya remitiendo
á Madrid, en gracia, obsequio, y para honesto recreo de los sencillos y
claros labradores, y de los muy honrados y prudentes comerciantes, fabricantes,
artesanos, menestrales, etc., aplicados y leales vasallos de S.M. á
quienes se las dedica</cite> (Madrid, 1799). The prolix humorist who wrote this work
declares (vol. i., p. 26) that the name was first applied to a certain Andrés
Quixano Cerro&mdash;of Tirteafuera, no mean city, and one familiar to readers of <cite>Don
Quixote</cite>, if not to geographers. This worthy is alleged to have supported the
Moorish forays with pious fortitude, and to have remarked: "Obremos en nuestra
defensa lo que dicte la razón en esta necesidad sin temer, y <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">esperemos en Dios</i>."
His holy calm so edified his neighbours that they ceased using the name of
Quixano Cerro and substituted Andrés de Espera en Dios in its stead. All of
which may be believed or not, as the reader chooses.&mdash;J. F.-K.</p></div></div>

<h2 class="nobreak">BOOK III.</h2>

<p>The joyful uproar there was that night in the village, on the
occasion of Daranio's wedding, did not prevent Elicio, Thyrsis,
Damon and Erastro from settling down together in a place
where, without being disturbed by anyone, Silerio might continue
the story he had begun, and he, when all together had
given him pleasing silence, continued in this wise:</p>

<p>'From the feigned stanzas to Blanca, which I have told you I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
repeated to Timbrio, he was satisfied that my pain proceeded
not from love of Nisida, but of her sister; and with this assurance,
begging my forgiveness for the false idea he had had about
me, he again entrusted me with his cure; and so I, forgetful of
my own, did not neglect in the least what concerned his. Some
days passed, during which fortune did not show me an opportunity
as open as I could wish for disclosing to Nisida the truth
of my thoughts, though she kept asking me how it was going
with my friend in his love-affair, and if his lady as yet had any
knowledge of it. In reply to this I said to her that the fear of
offending her still kept me from venturing to tell her anything;
whereat Nisida was very angry, calling me coward and of little
sense, and adding to this that since I was playing the coward,
either Timbrio did not feel the grief I reported of him, or I was
not so true a friend of his as I said. All this induced me to
make up my mind and reveal myself at the first opportunity,
which I did one day when she was alone. She listened with
strange silence to all I had to say to her, and I, as best I could,
extolled to her Timbrio's worth, and the true love he had for her,
which was so strong that it had brought me to take up so lowly
a pursuit as that of a buffoon, merely to have an opportunity of
telling her what I was telling her. To these I added other
reasonings which Nisida must needs have thought were not
without reason; but she would not show by words then what
she could not afterwards keep concealed by deeds; rather with
dignity and rare modesty she reproved my boldness, rebuked
my daring, blamed my words and daunted my confidence, but
not in such a way as to banish me from her presence, which was
what I feared most; she merely ended by telling me to have
henceforward more regard for what was due to her modesty,
and to see to it that the artifice of my false dress should not be
discovered&mdash;an ending this which closed and finished the
tragedy of my life, since I understood thereby that Nisida would
give ear to Timbrio's plaints. In what breast could or can be
contained the extremity of grief that was then concealed in mine,
since the end of its greatest desire was the finish and end of its
happiness? I was gladdened by the good beginning I had given
to Timbrio's cure, and this gladness redounded to my hurt, for it
seemed to me, as was the truth, that, on seeing Nisida in
another's power, my own was ended. Oh mighty force of true
friendship, how far dost thou extend! how far didst thou constrain
me! since I myself, impelled by thy constraint, by my own
contriving whetted the knife which was to cut short my hopes,
which, dying in my soul, lived and revived in Timbrio's, when
he learned from me all that had passed with Nisida. But her
way with him and me was so coy that she never showed at all
that she was pleased with my solicitude or Timbrio's love, nor
yet was she disdainful in such a manner that her displeasure and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
aversion made us both abandon the enterprise. This went on
till it came to Timbrio's knowledge that his enemy Pransiles, the
gentleman he had wronged in Xeres, being desirous of satisfying
his honour, was sending him a challenge, indicating to him a free
and secure field on an estate in the Duke of Gravina's territory,
and giving him a term of six months from that date to the day
of the combat. The care induced by this news did not cause
him to become careless in what concerned his love-affair, but
rather, by fresh solicitude on my part and services on his, Nisida
came to demean herself in such a way that she did not show
herself disdainful though Timbrio looked at her and visited at
the house of her parents, preserving in all a decorum as honourable
as befitted her worth. The term of the challenge now
drawing near, Timbrio, seeing that the journey was inevitable
for him, determined to depart, and before doing so, he wrote to
Nisida a letter, of such a kind that with it he ended in a moment
what I during many months and with many words had not
begun. I have the letter in my memory, and to render my story
complete, I will not omit to tell you that it ran thus:</p>


<div class="p1 center">T<small>IMBRIO TO</small> N<small>ISIDA</small></div>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">All hail to Nisida, from a loving swain</span><br />
Who is not hale nor ever hopes to be,<br />
Until his health from thine own hand he gain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These lines, I fear, will surely gain for me,</span><br />
Though they be written in my very blood,<br />
The abhorred reproach of importunity.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet I may not, e'en although I would,</span><br />
Escape Love's torment, for my passions bear<br />
My soul along amidst their cruel flood.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fiery daring and a chilly fear</span><br />
Encompass me about, and I remain,<br />
Whilst thou dost read this letter, sad and drear;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For when I write to thee, I do but gain</span><br />
Ruin if thou dost scorn my words, ah woe!<br />
And spurn my awkward phrases with disdain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">True Heaven is my witness and doth know</span><br />
If I have not adored thee from the hour<br />
I saw the lovely face that is my foe.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw thee and adored&mdash;What wouldst thou more?</span><br />
The peerless semblance of an angel fair<br />
What man is there but straightway would adore?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon thy beauty, in the world so rare,</span><br />
My soul so keenly gazed that on thy face<br />
It could not rest its piercing gaze, for there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within thy soul it was upon the trace</span><br />
Of mighty loveliness, a paradise<br />
Giving assurance of a greater grace.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On these rich pinions thou to Heaven dost rise</span><br />
And on the earth thou sendest dread and pain<br />
Unto the simple, wonder to the wise.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Happy the soul that doth such bliss contain,</span><br />
And no less happy he who to Love's war<br />
Yields up his own that blissful soul to gain!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Debtor am I unto my fatal star,</span><br />
That bade me yield to one who doth possess<br />
Within so fair a frame a soul so fair.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To me thy mood, oh lady, doth confess</span><br />
That I was wrong when I aspired so high,<br />
And covereth with fear my hopefulness.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But on my honest purpose I rely,</span><br />
I turn a bold face to despondency,<br />
New breath I gain when I to death am nigh.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They say that without hope Love cannot be.</span><br />
'Tis mere opinion: for I hope no more<br />
And yet the more Love's force doth master me.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I love thee for thy goodness, and adore,</span><br />
Thy beauty draws me captive in its train,<br />
It was the net Love stretched in love's first hour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That with rare subtlety it might constrain</span><br />
This soul of mine, careless and fancy-free,<br />
Unto the amorous knot, to know its strain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love his dominion and his tyranny</span><br />
Within some breasts sustains by beauty's aid,<br />
But not within the curious fantasy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which looks not on Love's narrow noose displayed</span><br />
In ringlets of fine gold that satisfy<br />
The heart of him who views them undismayed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor on the breast that he who turns his eye</span><br />
On breast alone, doth alabaster call<br />
Nor on the wondrous neck of ivory;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But it regards the hidden all in all</span><br />
And contemplates the thousand charms displayed<br />
Within the soul that succour and enthral.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The charms that are but mortal, doomed to fade,</span><br />
Unto the soul immortal bring not balm,<br />
Unless it leave the light and seek the shade.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy peerless virtue carrieth off the palm,</span><br />
It maketh of my thoughts its spoil and prey,<br />
And all my lustful passions it doth calm.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They are content and willingly obey,</span><br />
For by the worth thy merits ever show<br />
They seek their hard and bitter pain to weigh.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I plough the sea and in the sand I sow</span><br />
When I am doomed by passion's mystic stress<br />
Beyond the viewing of thy face to go.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I know how high thou art; my lowliness</span><br />
I see, and where the distance is so great,<br />
One may not hope, nor do I hope possess.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherefore I find no cure to heal my state,</span><br />
Numerous my hardships as the stars of night,<br />
Or as the tribes the earth that populate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I understand what for my soul is right,</span><br />
I know the better, and the worse attain,<br />
Borne by the love wherein I take delight.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now, fair Nisida, the point I gain,</span><br />
Which I with mortal anguish do desire,<br />
Where I shall end the sorrow I sustain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Uplifted is the hostile arm in ire,</span><br />
The keen and ruthless sword awaiteth me,<br />
Each with thine anger 'gainst me doth conspire.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy wrathful will soon, soon, avenged will be</span><br />
Upon the vain presumption of my will,<br />
Which was without a reason spurned by thee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No other pangs nor agonies would fill</span><br />
With agitation dread my mournful thought,<br />
Though greater than death's agonizing chill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I could in my short and bitter lot</span><br />
But see thee towards my heart-felt wishes kind,<br />
As the reverse I see, that thou art not.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Narrow the path that leads to bliss, I find,</span><br />
But broad and spacious that which leads to pain;<br />
By my misfortune this hath been designed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And death, that buttressed is on thy disdain,</span><br />
By this in anger and in haste doth run,<br />
Eager its triumph o'er my life to gain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By yonder path my bliss, well-nigh undone,</span><br />
Departs, crushed by the sternness thou dost show,<br />
Which needs must end my brief life all too soon.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My fate hath raised me to the height of woe</span><br />
Where I begin e'en now to dread the scorn<br />
And anger of my sore-offended foe.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis that I see the fire wherein I burn</span><br />
Is ice within thy breast, and this is why<br />
At the last moment I a coward turn.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For if thou dost not show thee my ally,</span><br />
Of whom will my weak hand be not afraid,<br />
Though strength and skill the more accompany?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What Roman warrior, if thou dost but aid,</span><br />
Or what Greek captain would oppose my might?<br />
Nay, from his purpose he would shrink dismayed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I would escape e'en from the direst plight,</span><br />
And from death's cruel hand away I'd bear<br />
The spoils of victory in his despite.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou, thou, alone my lot aloft canst rear</span><br />
Above all human glory, or abase<br />
Unto the depths below&mdash;no bliss is there.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For if, as pure Love had the power to raise,</span><br />
Fortune were minded to uphold my lot<br />
Safe 'midst the dangers of its lofty place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My hope which lieth where it hopeth naught,</span><br />
Itself would see exalted to a height<br />
Above the heaven where reigns the moon, in thought.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such am I that I now account delight</span><br />
The evil that thine angry scorn doth give<br />
Unto my soul in such a wondrous plight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If in thy memory I might see I live,</span><br />
And that perchance thou dost remember, sweet,<br />
To deal the wound which I as bliss receive.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twere easier far for me the tale complete</span><br />
To tell of the white sands beside the sea,<br />
Or of the stars that make the eighth heaven their seat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than all the pain, the grief, the anxiety,</span><br />
Whereto the rigour of thy cruel disdain<br />
Condemns me, though I have not wounded thee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seek not the measure of thy worth to gain</span><br />
From my humility; if we compare<br />
Loftiness with thee, 'twill on earth remain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such as I am I love thee, and I dare</span><br />
To say that I advance in loving sure<br />
Unto the highest point in Love's career,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherefore in merit I am not so poor</span><br />
That as an enemy thou shouldst me treat&mdash;<br />
Rather, methinks, my guerdon should endure.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So great a cruelty doth ill befit</span><br />
Such loveliness, and where we do perceive<br />
Such worth, there doth ingratitude ill sit.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On thee fain would I call account to give</span><br />
Of a soul yielded thee; where was it thrown?<br />
How, when my soul is gone, do I yet live?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Didst thou not deign to make my heart thy throne?</span><br />
What can he give thee more who loves thee more?<br />
Herein how well was thy presumption shown!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have been soulless from the earliest hour</span><br />
I saw thee for my bliss and for my pain,<br />
For all were pain if I saw thee no more.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There I of my free heart gave thee the rein,</span><br />
Thou rulest me, for thee alone I live,<br />
And yet thy power can more than this attain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the flame of pure Love I revive</span><br />
And am undone, since from the death of Love<br />
I, like a phœnix, straightway life receive.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This would I have thee think all things above,</span><br />
In faith of this my faith, that it is sure<br />
That I live glowing in the fire of Love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that thou canst e'en after death restore</span><br />
Me unto life, and in a moment guide<br />
From the wild ocean to the peaceful shore.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Love in thee and power dwell side by side,</span><br />
And are united, reigning over me.<br />
They waver not nor falter in their pride&mdash;<br />
And here I end lest I should weary thee.</p>

<p class="p01">'I know not whether it was the reasonings of this letter, or the
many I had urged before on Nisida, assuring her of the true love
Timbrio had for her, or Timbrio's ceaseless services, or Heaven
that had so ordained it, that moved Nisida's heart to call me at
the moment she finished reading it, and with tears in her eyes
to say to me: "Ah, Silerio, Silerio! I verily believe that you have
at the cost of my peace sought to gain your friend's! May the
fates that have brought me to this pass make Timbrio's deeds
accord with your words; and if both have deceived me, may
Heaven take vengeance for my wrong, Heaven which I call to
witness for the violence desire does me, making me keep it
no longer concealed. But, alas, how light an acquittal is this
for so weighty a fault! since I ought rather to die in silence so
that my honour might live, than by saying what I now wish
to say to you to bury it and end my life." These words of
Nisida's made me confused, and yet more the agitation with
which she uttered them; and desiring by mine to encourage her
to declare herself without any fear, I had not to importune her
much, for at last she told me that she not only loved, but adored
Timbrio, and that she would always have concealed that feeling
had not the compulsion of Timbrio's departure compelled her
to disclose it. It is not possible to describe fitly the state I was
in, shepherds, on hearing what Nisida said, and the feeling of
love she showed she bore to Timbrio; and indeed it is well that
a grief which extends so far should be beyond description.
Not that I was grieved to see Timbrio loved, but to see myself
rendered incapable of ever having happiness, since it was, and
is clear, that I neither could nor can live without Nisida; for to
see her, as I have said at other times, placed in another's arms,
was to sever myself from all pleasure, and if fate granted me
any at this pass, it was to consider the welfare of my friend
Timbrio, and this was the cause why my death and the
declaration of Nisida's love did not occur at one and the same
moment. I listened to her as well as I could, and assured
her as well as I knew how of the integrity of Timbrio's breast,
whereat she replied to me that there was no need to assure her
of that, for that she was of such a mind that she could not,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
nor ought she to, fail to believe me, only asking me, if it were
possible, to manage to persuade Timbrio to seek some honourable
means to avoid a combat with his foe: and when I
replied that this was impossible without his being dishonoured,
she was calmed, and taking from her neck some precious relics,
she gave them to me that I might give them to Timbrio from
her. As she knew her parents were to go and see Timbrio's
fight, and would take her and her sister with them, but as she
would not have the courage to be present at Timbrio's dire
peril, it was also agreed between us that she should pretend
to be indisposed, on which pretext she would remain in a
pleasure-house where her parents were to lodge, which was half
a league from the town where the combat was to take place, and
that there she would await her bad or good fortune, according
to Timbrio's. She bade me also, in order to shorten the anxiety
she would feel to learn Timbrio's fortune, take with me a white
kerchief which she gave me, and, if Timbrio conquered, bind
it on my arm, and come back to give her the news; and,
if he were vanquished, not to bind it, and so she would learn
from afar by the token of the kerchief the beginning of her
bliss or the end of her life. I promised her to do all she bade
me, and taking the relics and the kerchief I took leave of
her with the greatest sadness and the greatest joy I ever felt;
my little fortune caused the sadness; Timbrio's great fortune
the gladness. He learnt from me what I brought him from
Nisida, whereat he was so joyous, happy, and proud, that the
danger of the battle he awaited he counted as naught, for it
seemed to him that in being favoured by his lady, not even
death itself would be able to gainsay him. For the present I
pass by in silence the exaggerated terms Timbrio used to show
himself grateful for what he owed to my solicitude; for they
were such that he seemed to be out of his senses while discoursing
thereon. Being cheered, then, and encouraged by
this good news, he began to make preparations for his departure,
taking as seconds a Spanish gentleman, and another, a Neapolitan.
And at the tidings of this particular duel countless people of the
kingdom were moved to see it, Nisida's parents also going there,
taking her and her sister Blanca with them. As it fell to
Timbrio to choose weapons, he wished to show that he based
his right, not on the advantage they possessed, but on the
justice that was his, and so those he chose were the sword and
dagger, without any defensive weapon. But few days were
wanting to the appointed term, when Nisida and her father, with
many other gentlemen, set out from the city of Naples; she,
having arrived first, reminded me many times not to forget our
agreement; but my wearied memory, which never served save
to remind me of things alone that were unpleasing to me, so as
not to change its character, forgot as much of what Nisida had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
told me as it saw was needful to rob me of life, or at least to set
me in the miserable state in which I now see myself.'</p>

<p>The shepherds were listening with great attention to what
Silerio was relating, when the thread of his story was interrupted
by the voice of a hapless shepherd, who was singing among
some trees, nor yet so far from the windows of the dwelling
where they were, but that all that he said could not fail to
be heard. The voice was such that it imposed silence on
Silerio, who in no wise wished to proceed, but rather asked
the other shepherds to listen to it, since for the little there
remained of his story, there would be time to finish it. This
would have annoyed Thyrsis and Damon, had not Elicio said
to them:</p>

<p>'Little will be lost, shepherds, in listening to the luckless
Mireno, who is without doubt the shepherd that is singing, and
whom fortune has brought to such a pass that I fancy he hopes
for nothing in the way of his happiness.'</p>

<p>'How can he hope for it,' said Erastro, 'if to-morrow Daranio
marries the shepherdess Silveria, whom he thought to wed?
But in the end Daranio's wealth has had more power with
Silveria's parents than the abilities of Mireno.'</p>

<p>'You speak truth,' replied Elicio: 'but with Silveria the love
she knew Mireno had for her should have had more power than
any treasure; the more so that Mireno is not so poor that his
poverty would be remarked, though Silveria were to wed him.'</p>

<p>Through these remarks which Elicio and Erastro uttered,
the desire to learn what Mireno was singing increased in the
shepherds; and so Silerio begged that no more might be said,
and all with attentive ears stopped to listen to him. He, distressed
by Silveria's ingratitude, seeing that next day she was
wedding Daranio, with the rage and grief this deed caused him,
had gone forth from his house accompanied only by his rebeck:
and invited by the solitude and silence of a tiny little meadow
which was hard by the walls of the village, and trusting that on
a night so peaceful no one would listen to him, he sat down at
the foot of a tree, and tuning his rebeck was singing in this wise:</p>

 By his triumphant hands will gathered be,<br />
 And his the victory,<br />
 Who was in fortune rich beyond his peers,<br />
 But in deserving poor&mdash;<br />
 'Tis fortune smooths the rough and makes it sure.</p>

 <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then he who sees his happiness depart</span><br />
 By any way, who doth his glory see<br />
 Transformed into such bitter grievous pain&mdash;<br />
 Why ends he not his life with all its smart?<br />
 Against the countless powers of destiny<br />
 Why strives he not to break the vital chain?<br />
 Slowly I pass amain<br />
 Unto the peril sweet of bitter death.<br />
 Wherefore, mine arm, bold 'midst thy weariness,<br />
 Endure thou the distress<br />
 Of living, since our lot it brighteneth<br />
 To know that 'tis Love's will<br />
 That grief should do the deed, as steel doth kill.</p>

 <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">My death is certain, for it cannot be</span><br />
 That he should live whose very hope is dead,<br />
 And who from glory doth so far remain.<br />
 Yet this I fear, that death, by Love's decree,<br />
 May be impossible, that memory fed<br />
 By a false confidence may live again<br />
 In my despite. What then?<br />
 For if the tale of my past happiness<br />
 I call to mind, and see that all is gone,<br />
 That I am now undone<br />
 By the sad cares I in its stead possess,<br />
 'Twill serve the more to show<br />
 That I from memory and from life should go.</p>

 <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ah! chief and only good my soul hath known!</span><br />
 Sun that didst calm the storm within my breast!<br />
 Goal of the worth that is desired by me!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span> Can it be that the day should ever dawn<br />
 When I must know that thou rememberest<br />
 No more, and Love that day doth let me see?<br />
 Rather, ere this should be,<br />
 Ere thy fair neck be by another's arms<br />
 In all its loveliness encircled, ere<br />
 Thy golden&mdash;nay thy hair<br />
 Is gold, and ere its gold in all its charms<br />
 Should make Daranio rich,<br />
 Its end may the evil with my life's end reach.</p>

 <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">None hath by faith better deserved than I</span><br />
 To win thee; but I see that faith is dead,<br />
 Unless it be by deeds made manifest.<br />
 To certain grief and to uncertain joy<br />
 I yield my life; and if I merited<br />
 Thereby, I might hope for a gladsome feast.<br />
 But in this cruellest<br />
 Law used by Love, hath good desire no place,<br />
 This proverb lovers did of old discover:<br />
 The deed declares the lover,<br />
 And as for me, who to my hurt possess<br />
 Naught but the will to do,<br />
 Wherein must I not fail, whose deeds are few?</p>

 <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">I thought the law would clearly broken be</span><br />
 In thee, that avaricious Love doth use;<br />
 I thought that thou thine eyes on high wouldst raise<br />
 Unto a captive soul that serves but thee,<br />
 So ready to perform what thou dost choose,<br />
 That, if thou didst but know, 'twould earn thy praise.<br />
 For a faith that assays<br />
 By the vain pomps of wealth so full of care<br />
 All its desires, thou wouldst not change, I thought,<br />
 A faith that was so fraught<br />
 With tokens of good faith, Silveria fair.<br />
 Thyself thou didst to gold<br />
 Yield that thou mightst yield me to grief untold.</p>

 <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh poverty, that creepest on the ground,</span><br />
 Cause of the grief that doth my soul enrage,<br />
 He praiseth thee, thy face who never saw.<br />
 Thy visage did my shepherdess confound,<br />
 At once thy harshness did her love assuage,<br />
 She to escape thee doth her foot withdraw.<br />
 This is thy cruel law,<br />
 Vainly doth one aspire the goal to find<br />
 Of amorous purpose; thou high hopes abasest<br />
 And countless changes placest<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span> Within the greedy breast of womankind,<br />
 But never dost thou bless<br />
 The worth of lovers with complete success.</p>

 <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gold is a sun, whose ray the keenest eyes</span><br />
 Blindeth, if on the semblance they be fed<br />
 Of interest, that doth beguile the sight.<br />
 He that is liberal-handed wins the prize,<br />
 Even her hand, who, by her avarice led,<br />
 Fair though she be, declares her heart's delight.<br />
 'Tis gold that turns the sight<br />
 From the pure purpose and the faith sincere;<br />
 More than a lover's firmness is undone<br />
 By the diamond stone,<br />
 Whose hardness turns to wax a bosom fair,<br />
 However hard it be;<br />
 Its fancy thus it winneth easily.</p>

 <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh sweet my foe I suffer grief untold</span><br />
 For thee, because thy matchless charms thou hast<br />
 Made ugly by a proof of avarice.<br />
 So much didst thou reveal thy love of gold<br />
 That thou my passion didst behind thee cast<br />
 And to oblivion didst my care dismiss.<br />
 Now thou art wed! Ah, this<br />
 Ends all! Wed, shepherdess! I pray that Heaven<br />
 Thy choice, as thou thyself wouldst wish, may bless,<br />
 That for my bitterness<br />
 A just reward may not to thee be given.&mdash;<br />
 But, alas! Heaven, our friend,<br />
 Guerdon to virtue, stripes to ill doth send.</p>

<p class="p01">Here the hapless Mireno ended his song with tokens of grief
so great that he inspired the same in all those who were
listening to him, especially in those who knew him, and were
acquainted with his virtues, gallant disposition and honourable
bearing. And after there had passed between the shepherds
some remarks upon the strange character of women, and chiefly
upon the marriage of Silveria, who, forgetful of Mireno's love
and goodness, had yielded herself to Daranio's wealth, they
were desirous that Silerio should end his story, and, complete
silence having been imposed, without needing to be asked, he
began to continue, saying:</p>

<p>'The day of the dire peril, then, having come, Nisida remained
half a league out of the village, in some gardens as she had
agreed with me, with the pretext she gave to her parents that
she was not well; and as I left her, she charged me to return
quickly, with the token of the kerchief, for, according as I wore
it or not, she would learn the good or ill fortune of Timbrio. I
promised it to her once more, being aggrieved that she should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
charge me with it so often. Therewith I took leave of her and
of her sister, who remained with her. And when I had come to
the place of combat and the hour of beginning it had come,
after the seconds of both had completed the ceremonies and
warnings which are required in such a case, the two gentlemen,
being set in the lists, at the dread sound of a hoarse trumpet
engaged with such dexterity and skill that it caused admiration
in all that saw them. But love or justice&mdash;and this is the more
likely&mdash;which was favouring Timbrio, gave him such vigour that,
though at the cost of some wounds, in a short space he put his
adversary in such a plight, that, having him at his feet, wounded
and covered with blood, he begged him to give in, if he wished
to save his life. But the luckless Pransiles urged him to make
an end of killing him, since it was easier for him and less hurtful
to pass through a thousand deaths than to surrender; yet
Timbrio's noble soul is such that he neither wished to kill his
foe, nor yet that he should confess himself vanquished. He
merely contented himself with his saying and acknowledging
that Timbrio was as good as he; which Pransiles confessed
gladly, since in this he did so little, that he might very well have
said it without seeing himself in that pass. All the bystanders who
heard how Timbrio had dealt with his foe, praised it and valued
it highly. Scarcely had I seen my friend's happy fortune, when with
incredible joy and swift speed I returned to give the news to
Nisida. But woe is me! for my carelessness then has set me
in my present care. Oh memory, memory mine! why had you
none for what concerned me so much? But I believe it was
ordained in my fortune, that the beginning of that gladness
should be the end and conclusion of all my joys. I returned to
see Nisida with the speed I have said, but returned without placing
the white kerchief on my arm. Nisida, who, from some lofty
galleries, with violent longing, was waiting and watching for my
return, seeing me returning without the kerchief, thought that some
sinister mishap had befallen Timbrio, and she believed it and
felt it in such wise, that, without aught else contributing, all her
spirits failed her, and she fell to the ground in so strange a
swoon, that all counted her dead. By the time I came up, I
found all her household in a turmoil, and her sister showing a
thousand extremes of grief over the body of sad Nisida. When
I saw her in such a state, firmly believing that she was dead, and
seeing that the force of grief was drawing me out of my senses,
and afraid that while bereft of them I might give or disclose some
tokens of my thoughts, I went forth from the house, and slowly
returned to give the luckless news to luckless Timbrio. But as
the anxiety of my grief had robbed me of my strength of mind and
body, my steps were not so swift but that others had been more
so to carry the sad tidings to Nisida's parents, assuring them
that she had been carried off by an acute paroxysm. Timbrio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
must needs have heard this and been in the same state as I was,
if not in a worse; I can only say that when I came to where I
thought to find him, the night was already somewhat advanced,
and I learned from one of his seconds that he had departed for
Naples with his other second by the post, with tokens of such great
unhappiness as if he had issued from the combat vanquished
and dishonoured. I at once fancied what it might be, and at
once set myself on the way to follow him, and before I reached
Naples, I had sure tidings that Nisida was not dead, but had
been in a swoon which lasted four and twenty hours, at the end
of which she had come to herself with many tears and sighs.
With the certainty of these tidings I was consoled, and with
greater joy reached Naples, thinking to find Timbrio there; but
it was not so, for the gentleman with whom he had come
assured me that on reaching Naples, he departed without saying
anything, and that he did not know whither; only he fancied
that, as he saw him sad and melancholy after the fight, he
could not but think he had gone to kill himself. This was
news which sent me back to my first tears, and my fortune, not
even content with this, ordained that at the end of a few days
Nisida's parents should come to Naples without her and without
her sister, who, as I learned, and as was the common report,
had both absented themselves one night, whilst coming with
their parents to Naples, without any news being known of them.
Thereat I was so confused that I knew not what to do with myself
nor what to say to myself, and being placed in this strange
confusion, I came to learn, though not very surely, that Timbrio
had embarked in the port of Gaeta on a large ship bound for
Spain. Thinking it might be true, I came straightway to Spain,
and have looked for him in Xeres and in every place I fancied
he might be, without finding any trace of him. At last I came
to the city of Toledo, where all the kinsmen of Nisida's parents
are, and what I succeeded in learning is that they have returned
to Toledo without having learned news of their daughters.
Seeing myself, then, absent from Timbrio and away from Nisida,
and considering that as soon as I should find them, it must needs
be to their joy and my ruin, being now wearied and disenchanted
of the things of this deceitful world in which we live, I have
resolved to turn my thoughts to a better pole-star, and to spend
the little that remains to me of life, in the service of Him who
values desires and works in the degree they deserve. And so I
have chosen this garb you see, and the hermitage you have
seen, where in sweet solitude I may repress my desires and
direct my works to a better goal; though, as the course of the evil
inclinations I have cherished till now, springs from so far back,
they are not so easy to check but that they somewhat overrun
the bounds, and memory returns to battle with me, representing
to me the past. When I see myself in this pass, to the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
yonder harp which I chose for companion in my solitude, I seek
to lighten the heavy burden of my cares until Heaven shall take
it and be minded to call me to a better life. This, shepherds,
is the story of my misfortune; and if I have been long in telling
it to you, it is because my misfortune has not been brief in
afflicting me. What I pray you is to allow me to return to my
hermitage, for, though your company is pleasing to me, I have
come to the pass that nothing gives me more joy than solitude,
and henceforward you will understand the life I lead and the
woe I endure.'</p>

<p>Herewith Silerio ended his story, but not the tears with which
he had ofttimes accompanied it. The shepherds consoled him
for them as best they could, especially Damon and Thyrsis, who
with many reasonings urged him not to lose the hope of seeing
his friend Timbrio in greater happiness than he could imagine,
since it was not possible but that after such evil fortune Heaven
should become serene, wherefrom it might be hoped that it
would not be willing for the false news of Nisida's death to come
to Timbrio's knowledge save in a truer version before despair
should end his days; and that, as regards Nisida it might be
believed and conjectured that, on finding Timbrio absent, she
had gone in search of him; and that, if fortune had then parted
them by such strange accidents, it would know now how to unite
them by others no less strange. All these reasonings and many
others they addressed to him, consoled him somewhat, but not so
as to awaken the hope of seeing himself in a life of greater happiness,
nor yet did he seek it, for it seemed to him that the life he
had chosen, was the one most fitting for him. A great part of the
night was already passed when the shepherds agreed to rest for
the little time that remained until the day, whereon the wedding
of Daranio and Silveria was to be celebrated. But scarce had
the white dawn left the irksome couch of her jealous spouse,
when most of the shepherds of the village all left theirs, and each
as best he could, for his part, began to gladden the feast. One
brought green boughs to adorn the doorway of the betrothed,
another with tabor and flute gave them the morning greeting.
Here was heard the gladdening pipe, here sounded the tuneful
rebeck, there the ancient psaltery, here the practised flageolet;
one with red ribands adorned his castanets for the hoped-for
dance, another polished and polished again his rustic finery to
show himself gallant in the eyes of some little shepherdess his
sweetheart, so that in whatever part of the village one went, all
savoured of happiness, pleasure, and festivity. There was only
the sad and hapless Mireno, to whom all these joys were the
cause of greatest sadness. He, having gone out from the village,
so as not to see performed the sacrifice of his glory, ascended a
hillock which was near the village, and seating himself there at
the foot of an old ash tree, placing his hand on his cheek, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
bonnet pulled down to his eyes which he kept rivetted on the
ground, he began to ponder the hapless plight in which he found
himself, and how, without being able to prevent it, he had to see
the fruit of his desires culled before his eyes; and this thought
held him in such a way that he wept so tenderly and bitterly
that no one could see him in such a pass without accompanying
him with tears. At this moment Damon and Thyrsis, Elicio and
Erastro arose, and appearing at a window which looked on to
the plain, the first object on which they set eyes was the luckless
Mireno, and on seeing him in the state in which he was, they
knew full well the grief he was suffering; and, being moved to
compassion, they determined all to go and console him, as they
would have done, had not Elicio begged them to let him go
alone, for he thought that, as Mireno was so great a friend of
his, he would impart his grief to him more freely than to another.
The shepherds consented to it, and Elicio, going there, found
Mireno so beside himself and so transported in his grief that he
neither recognised him nor spoke to him a word. Elicio, seeing
this, beckoned to the other shepherds to come, and they, fearing
that some strange accident had befallen Mireno, since Elicio
called them with haste, straightway went there, and saw Mireno
with eyes so fixed on the ground, and so motionless that he
seemed a statue, seeing that he did not awake from his strange
trance with the coming of Elicio nor with that of Thyrsis,
Damon and Erastro, except that after a long while he began to
say as it were between his teeth:</p>

<p>'Are you Silveria, Silveria? if you are, I am not Mireno, and
if I am not Mireno, you are not Silveria, for it is not possible for
Silveria to be without Mireno, or Mireno without Silveria. Then
who am I, hapless one? or who are you, ungrateful one? Full
well I know that I am not Mireno, for you have not wished to
be Silveria, at least the Silveria you ought to have been and I
thought you were.'</p>

<p>At this moment he raised his eyes, and as he saw the four
shepherds round him and recognised Elicio among them, he
arose and without ceasing his bitter plaint, threw his arms round
his neck, saying to him:</p>

<p>'Ah, my true friend, now indeed you will have no cause to
envy my state, as you envied it when you saw me favoured by
Silveria; for, if you called me happy then, you can call me
hapless now, and change all the glad names you gave me then,
into the grievous ones you now can give me. I indeed will be
able to call you happy, Elicio, since you are more consoled by
the hope you have of being loved than afflicted by the real fear
of being forgotten.'</p>

<p>'You make me perplexed, oh Mireno,' answered Elicio, 'to see
the extreme grief you display at what Silveria has done, when you
know that she has parents whom it was right to have obeyed.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>'If she felt love,' replied Mireno, 'duty to parents were small
hindrance to keep her from fulfilling what she owed to love.
Whence I come to think, oh Elicio, that if she loved me well,
she did ill to marry, and if the love she used to show me was
feigned, she did worse in deceiving me and in offering to undeceive
me at a time when it cannot avail me save by leaving
my life in her hands.'</p>

<p>'Your life, Mireno,' replied Elicio, 'is not in such a pass that
for cure you have to end it, since it might be that the change in
Silveria was not in her will, but in the constraint of obedience to
her parents; and, if you loved her purely and honourably when
a maid, you can also love her now that she is wed, she responding
now as then to your good and honourable desires.'</p>

<p>'Little do you know Silveria, Elicio,' answered Mireno, 'since
you imagine of her that she is likely to do aught that might
make her notorious.'</p>

<p>'This very argument you have used, condemns you,' replied
Elicio, 'since, if you, Mireno, know of Silveria that she will not
do anything which may be hurtful to her, she cannot have erred
in what she has done.'</p>

<p>'If she has not erred,' answered Mireno, 'she has succeeded
in robbing me of all the fair issue I hoped from my fair thoughts;
and only in this do I blame her that she never warned me of
this blow, nay rather, when I had fears of it, she assured me
with a firm oath that they were fancies of mine, and that it had
never entered her fancy to think of marrying Daranio, nor, if
she could not marry me, would she marry him nor anyone else,
though she were thereby to risk remaining in perpetual disgrace
with her parents and kinsmen; and under this assurance and
promise now to fail in and break her faith in the way you have
seen&mdash;what reason is there that would consent to such a thing,
or what heart that would suffer it?'</p>

<p>Here Mireno once more renewed his plaint and here again the
shepherds had pity for him. At this moment two youths came
up to where they were; one of them was Mireno's kinsman, the
other a servant of Daranio's who came to summon Elicio,
Thyrsis, Damon and Erastro, for the festivities of his marriage
were about to begin. It grieved the shepherds to leave Mireno
alone, but the shepherd his kinsman offered to remain with him,
and indeed Mireno told Elicio that he wished to go away from
that region, so as not to see every day before his eyes the cause
of his misfortune. Elicio praised his resolve and charged him,
wherever he might be, to inform him how it went with him.
Mireno so promised him; and drawing from his bosom a paper,
he begged him to give it to Silveria on finding an opportunity.
Therewith he took leave of all the shepherds, not without token
of much grief and sadness. He had not gone far from their
presence, when Elicio, desirous of learning what was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
paper, seeing that, since it was open, it mattered but little if he
read it, unfolded it, and inviting the other shepherds to listen to
him, saw that in it were written these verses:</p>


<p class="p1 center">M<small>IRENO TO</small> S<small>ILVERIA.</small></p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">

All the joyous time of youth!</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did that error but endure,</span><br />
Tempered were my bitter sadness;<br />
Fancied joy brings greater gladness<br />
Than a loss well known and sure.<br />
But 'twas thou that didst ordain<br />
My misfortune and distress,<br />
Making by thy fickleness<br />
False my bliss and sure my pain.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">From thy words so full of lies</span><br />

Fancied joys have I received,<br />
And undoubted miseries.<br />

With the buoyancy of youth,<br />

To my sorrow do redound.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hence I judge and know full well,</span><br />
And it cannot be denied,<br />
That its glory and its pride<br />
Love hath at the gates of hell;<br />
Whoso doth not set his gaze<br />
Upon Love, from joy to pain<br />
By oblivion and disdain<br />
Is brought in a moment's space.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With such swiftness thou hast wrought</span><br />
This mysterious transformation,<br />
That already desperation<br />
And not gain becomes my lot;<br />
For methinks 'twas yesterday<br />

Love at least, for this is plain,<br />
What I must believe to-day.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still thy pleasing voice I hear</span><br />
Uttering sweet and witty things,<br />
Still thy loving reasonings<br />
Are resounding in my ear;<br />
But these memories at last,<br />

Since away the breezes bore<br />
Words and works adown the blast.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wert thou she who in her pride</span><br />
Swore her days on earth should end,<br />
If she did not love her friend<br />
More than all she loved beside?<br />
Wert thou she who to me showed<br />

That, although I was her ill,<br />
She did hold me for her good?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh if but I could thee hate</span><br />
As thou hatest me, thy name<br />
Would I brand with fitting shame,<br />
Since thou'rt thankless and ingrate;<br />
Yet it useless is for me<br />
Thus to hate thee and disdain,<br />
Love to me is greater gain<br />
Than forgetfulness to thee.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To my singing sad lament,</span><br />
To my springtime winter's snow,<br />

To the garb of those that mourn,<br />
Love's soft flower to poignant thorn,<br />
Love's sweet fruit to bitterness.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou wilt say&mdash;thereat I bleed&mdash;</span><br />
That thy marriage to this swain,<br />
Thy forgetfulness again,<br />
Is a noble honest deed;<br />
If it were not known to thee<br />
That in thy betrothal hour<br />

Then I might admit thy plea.</p>

Faints not through my misery.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">None will wonder&mdash;surely no man,</span><br />
When he comes to know the truth,<br />
Seeing that I am a youth,<br />
And, Silveria, thou art woman;<br />
Ever in her, we believe,<br />

For thou may'st it hate at last,<br />
But for ever 'twill be there.</p>

<p>The shepherds did not think ill of Mireno's verses, but of the
occasion for which they had been made, considering with
what rapidity Silveria's fickleness had brought him to the pass
of abandoning his beloved country and dear friends, each one
fearful lest, as the result of his suit, the same thing might
happen to him. Then, after they had entered the village and
come to where Daranio and Silveria were, the festivities began
with as much joy and merriment as had been seen for a long
time on the banks of the Tagus; for, as Daranio was one of
the richest shepherds of all that district, and Silveria one of the
fairest shepherdesses of all the river-side, all or most of the
shepherds of those parts assisted at their wedding. And so
there was a fine gathering of discreet shepherds and fair shepherdesses,
and amongst those who excelled the rest in many
different qualities were the sad Orompo, the jealous Orfenio,
the absent Crisio, and the love-lorn Marsilio, all youths and
all in love, though oppressed by different passions, for sad
Orompo was tormented by the untimely death of his beloved
Listea, jealous Orfenio by the unbearable rage of jealousy,
being in love with the fair shepherdess Eandra, absent Crisio
by seeing himself parted from Claraura, a fair and discreet
shepherdess, whom he counted his only joy, and despairing
Marsilio by the hatred against him existing in Belisa's breast.
They were all friends and from the same village; each was
not ignorant of the other's love, but, on the contrary, in
mournful rivalry they had ofttimes come together, each to
extol the cause of his torment, seeking each one to show,
as best he could, that his grief exceeded every other,
counting it the highest glory to be superior in pain; and all
had such wit, or, to express it better, suffered such grief,
that, however they might indicate it, they showed it was the
greatest that could be imagined. Through these disputes and
rivalries they were famous and renowned on all the banks of
the Tagus, and had caused in Thyrsis and Damon desire
to know them; and, seeing them there together, they offered
one another courteous and pleasing greetings, all especially
regarding with admiration the two shepherds Thyrsis and
Damon, up till then only known to them by repute. At this
moment came the rich shepherd Daranio, dressed in mountain
garb; he wore a high-necked smock with pleated collar, a frieze
vest, a green coat cut low at the neck, breeches of fine linen,
blue gaiters, round shoes, a studded belt, and a quartered
bonnet the colour of the coat. No less finely adorned came
forth his bride Silveria, for she came with skirt and bodice of
fawn, bordered with white satin, a tucker worked with blue
and green, a neckerchief of yellow thread sprinkled with silver
embroidery, the contrivance of Galatea and Florisa, who
dressed her, a turquoise-coloured coif with fringes of red silk,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
gilded pattens of cork, dainty close-fitting shoes, rich corals, a
ring of gold, and above all her beauty, which adorned her more
than all. After her came the peerless Galatea, like the sun after
the dawn, and her friend Florisa, with many other fair
shepherdesses, who had come to the wedding to honour it; and
amongst them, too, came Teolinda, taking care to conceal her
face from the eyes of Damon and Thyrsis, so as not to be
recognised by them. And straightway the shepherdesses,
following the shepherds their guides, to the sound of many rustic
instruments, made their way to the temple, during which time
Elicio and Erastro found time to feast their eyes on Galatea's
fair countenance, desiring that that way might last longer than
the long wandering of Ulysses. And, at the joy of seeing her,
Erastro was so beside himself, that addressing Elicio he said to
him:</p>

<p>'What are you looking at, shepherd, if you are not looking at
Galatea? But how will you be able to look at the sun of her
locks, the heaven of her brow, the stars of her eyes, the snow of
her countenance, the crimson of her cheeks, the colour of her
lips, the ivory of her teeth, the crystal of her neck, and the
marble of her breast?'</p>

<p>'All this have I been able to see, oh Erastro,' replied Elicio,
'and naught of all you have said is the cause of my torment,
but it is the hardness of her disposition, for if it were not such
as you know, all the graces and beauties you recognise in
Galatea would be the occasion of our greater glory.'</p>

<p>'You say well,' said Erastro; 'but yet you will not be able to
deny to me, that if Galatea were not so fair, she would not be
so desired, and if she were not so desired, our pain would not be
so great, since it all springs from desire.'</p>

<p>'I cannot deny to you, Erastro,' replied Elicio, 'that all grief
and sorrow whatsoever springs from the want and lack of that
which we desire; but at the same time I wish to tell you that
the quality of the love with which I thought you loved Galatea
has fallen greatly in my estimation, for if you merely love her
because she is fair, she has very little to thank you for, since
there will be no man, however rustic he be, who sees her but
desires her, for beauty, wherever it be, carries with it the
power of creating desire. Thus no reward is due to this
simple desire, because it is so natural, for if it were due, by
merely desiring Heaven, we would have deserved it. But you
see already, Erastro, that the opposite is so much the case, as our
true law has shown to us; and granted that beauty and loveliness
are a principal factor in attracting us to desire them and to
seek to enjoy them, he who would be a true lover must not count
such enjoyment his highest good; but rather, though beauty
causes this desire in him, he must love the one only because the
desire is honourable, without any other interest moving him, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
this can be called, even in things of this life, perfect and true
love, and is worthy of gratitude and reward. Just as we see that
the Maker of all things openly and fittingly rewards those who,
not being moved by any other interest, whether of fear, pain, or
hope of glory, love Him, worship Him, and serve Him only
because he is good and worthy of being worshipped; and this
is the last and greatest perfection contained in divine love, and
in human love, too, when one does not love except because what
one loves is good, without there being an error of judgment, for
ofttimes the bad seems to us good, and the good bad, and so we
love the one and abhor the other, and such love as this does not
deserve reward but punishment. I wish to imply from all I have
said, oh Erastro, that if you love and worship Galatea's beauty
with intent to enjoy it, and the goal of your desire stops at this
point without passing on to love her virtue, her increase of fame,
her welfare, her life and prosperity, know that you do not love
as you ought, nor ought you to be rewarded as you wish.'</p>

<p>Erastro would fain have replied to Elicio, and given him to
understand that he did not understand rightly concerning the
love with which he loved Galatea; but this was prevented by
the sound of the pipe of loveless Lenio, who also wished to be
present at Daranio's wedding, and to gladden the festivities
with his song; and so setting himself in front of the betrothed
pair, whilst they were going to the temple, to the sound of
Eugenio's rebeck he went singing these verses:</p>

<p class="p01">Already those who listened to the loveless Lenio as they went
along were wondering at seeing with what meekness he was treating
the things of Love, calling him a god, and of a mighty hand&mdash;a
thing they had never heard him say. But having heard
the verses with which he ended his song, they could not refrain
from laughter, for it already seemed to them that he was getting
angry as he went on, and that if he proceeded further in his
song, he would deal with love as he was wont at other times;
but time failed him, for the way was at an end. And so, when
they had come to the temple, and the usual ceremonies had
been performed therein by the priests, Daranio and Silveria
remained bound in a tight and perpetual knot, not without the
envy of many who saw them, nor without the grief of some who
coveted Silveria's beauty. But every grief would have been
surpassed by that which the hapless Mireno would have felt,
had he been present at this spectacle. The wedded pair having
returned from the temple with the same company that had
escorted them, came to the village square, where they found the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
tables set, and where Daranio wished publicly to make a
demonstration of his wealth, offering to all the people a liberal
and sumptuous feast. The square was so covered with branches,
that it seemed a lovely green forest, the branches interwoven
above in such wise that the sun's keen rays in all that compass
found no entry to warm the cool ground, which was covered
with many sword-lilies and a great diversity of flowers. There,
then, to the general content of all was celebrated the liberal
banquet, to the sound of many pastoral instruments, which gave
no less pleasure than is wont to be given by the bands playing
in harmony usual in royal palaces; but that which most
exalted the feast was to see, that, on removing the tables, they
made with much speed in the same place a stage, because
the four discreet and hapless shepherds, Orompo, Marsilio,
Crisio, and Orfenio, so as to honour their friend Daranio's
wedding, and to satisfy the desire Thyrsis and Damon had to
hear them, wished there in public to recite an eclogue, which
they themselves had composed on the occasion of their own
griefs. All the shepherds and shepherdesses who were there
being then arranged in their seats, after that Erastro's pipe, and
Lenio's lyre and the other instruments made those present keep
peaceful and marvellous silence, the first who showed himself in
the humble theatre was the sad Orompo, clad in black skin-coat,
and a crook of yellow box-wood in his hand, the end of
which was an ugly figure of Death. He came crowned with
leaves of mournful cypress, all emblems of grief which reigned
in him by reason of the untimely death of his beloved Listea;
and after he had, with sad look, turned his weeping eyes in all
directions, with tokens of infinite grief and bitterness he broke
the silence with words like these:</p>

<p class="p01">O<small>ROMPO.</small></p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come from the depths of my grief-stricken breast,</span><br />
Oh words of blood, with death commingled come,<br />
Break open the left side that keeps you dumb,<br />
If 'tis my sighs perchance that hold you fast.<br />
The air impedes you, for 'tis fired at last<br />
By the fierce poison of your utterance;<br />
Come forth and let the breezes bear you hence,<br />
As they have borne my bliss adown the blast.</p>

Famed were ye once, of high renown were ye,<br />
For sweetness, and for wittiness and gladness;<br />
But now for bitterness, for tears and sadness,<br />
Will ye by Heaven and earth appraisèd be.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Although ye issue trembling at my cry</span><br />
With what words can ye utter what I feel,<br />
If my fierce torment is incapable<br />
Of being as 'tis painted vividly?<br />
Alas, for neither means nor time have I<br />
To express the pain and sinking at my heart;<br />
But what my tongue doth lack to tell its smart,<br />
My eyes by constant weeping may supply.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh death, who cuttest short by cruel guile</span><br />
A thousand pleasant purposes of man,<br />
And in a moment turnest hill to plain,<br />
Making Henares equal unto Nile,<br />
Why didst thou temper not thy cruel style,<br />
Traitor, and why didst thou, in my despite,<br />
Make trial on a bosom fair and white<br />
Of thy fierce hanger's edge with fury vile?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">How came it that the green and tender years</span><br />
Of that fair lamb did, false one, thee displease?<br />
Wherefore didst thou my woes by hers increase?<br />
Why didst thou show thyself to her so fierce?<br />

Goest thou from me who seek thee, and concealest<br />
Thyself from me, while thou thyself revealest<br />
To him who more than I thy evils fears?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">On riper years thy law tyrannical</span><br />
Might well its giant vigour have displayed,<br />
Nor dealt its cruel blow against a maid,<br />
Who hath of living had enjoyment small;<br />
But yet thy sickle which arrangeth all&mdash;<br />
By no prayer turned aside nor word of power&mdash;<br />
Moweth with ruthless blade the tender flower<br />
E'en as the knotty reed, stalwart and tall.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">When thou Listea from the world away</span><br />
Didst take, thy nature and thy strength, thy worth,<br />
Thy spirit, wrath and lordship to the earth<br />
Thou didst by that proud deed alone display.<br />
All that the earth possesseth fair and gay,<br />
Graceful and witty, thou didst likewise doom,<br />
When thou didst doom Listea; in her tomb<br />
Thou didst with her this wealth of blisses lay.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">My painful life grows longer, and its weight</span><br />

His life is death who is not fortunate.<br />
I have no hope in fortune nor in fate,<br />
I have no hope in time, no hope in Heaven;<br />
I may not hope for solace to be given,<br />
Nor yet for good where evil is so great.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh ye who feel what sorrow is, come, find</span><br />
In mine your consolation, when ye see<br />
Its strength, its vigour and alacrity;<br />
Then ye will see how far yours falls behind.<br />
Where are ye now, shepherds graceful and kind,<br />
Crisio, Marsilio, and Orfenio?&nbsp;  What<br />
Do ye?&nbsp;  Why come ye not?&nbsp;  Why count ye not<br />
Mine greater far than troubles of your mind?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">But who is this who cometh into sight,</span><br />
Emerging at the crossing of yon path?<br />
Marsilio 'tis, whom Love as prisoner hath,<br />
The cause Belisa, her praise his delight.<br />
The fierce snake of disdain with cruel bite<br />
His soul doth ever gnaw and eke his breast,<br />
He spends his life in torment without rest,<br />
And yet not his but mine the blacker plight.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">He thinks the ill that makes his soul complain</span><br />
Is greater than the sorrow of my woe.<br />
Within this thicket 'twill be well to go,<br />
That I may see if he perchance complain.<br />
Alas! to think to match it with the pain<br />
That never leaves me is but vanity.<br />
The road mine opens that to ill draws nigh,<br />
Closing the pathway that doth bliss attain.</p>

<p class="p01">With this last song of the jealous Orfenio, the discreet shepherds
made an end of their eclogue, leaving all who had heard
them satisfied with their discretion: especially Damon and
Thyrsis, who felt great pleasure at hearing them, for it seemed
to them that the reasonings and arguments which the four
shepherds had propounded to carry through their proposition,
seemed of more than shepherd wit. But a contest having arisen
between many of the bystanders as to which of the four had
pleaded his cause best, at last the opinion of all came to agree
with that which discreet Damon gave, saying to them that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
for his part held that, among all the distasteful and unpleasing
things that love brings with it, nothing so much distresses the
loving breast as the incurable plague of jealousy, and neither
Orompo's loss, nor Crisio's absence, nor Marsilio's despair
could be equalled to it.</p>

<p>'The cause is,' he said, 'that it is not in reason that
things which have become impossible of attainment should be
able for long to compel the will to love them, or weary the
desire to attain them; for when a man has the will and desire
to attain the impossible, it is clear that the more desire is
excessive in him, the more he would lack understanding. And
for this same reason I say that the pain Orompo suffers is but
grief and pity for a lost happiness; and because he has lost it in
such a way that it is not possible to recover it again, this
impossibility must be the cause of his sorrow ending. For
although human understanding cannot be always so united with
reason as to cease feeling the loss of the happiness which cannot
be recovered, and must in fact give tokens of its feeling by tender
tears, ardent sighs, and piteous words, under pain, should one
not do this, of being counted rather brute than rational man&mdash;in
a word, the course of time cures this sorrowing, reason softens
it, and new events have a great share in blotting it from memory.
All this is the contrary in absence, as Crisio well pointed out in
his verses, for, as in the absent one, hope is so united to desire,
the postponement of return gives him terrible distress; seeing
that, as nothing hinders him from enjoying his happiness except
some arm of the sea, or some stretch of land, it seems to him,
having the chief thing, which is the good-will of the beloved
person, that flagrant wrong is done to his bliss, in that things so
trivial as a little water or land should hinder his happiness and
glory. To this pain are also joined the fear of being forgotten,
and the changes of human hearts; and so long as absence
endures, strange without a doubt is the harshness and rigour
with which it treats the soul of the hapless absent one. But as
it has the remedy so near, which consists in return, its torment
can be borne with some ease; and if it should happen that the
absence should be such that it is impossible to return to the
desired presence, that impossibility comes to be the remedy, as
in the case of death. As for the sorrow of which Marsilio complains,
though it is, as it were, the same that I suffer, and on
this account must needs have seemed to me greater than any
other, I will not therefore fail to say what reason shows me,
rather than that to which passion urges me. I confess that it is
a terrible sorrow to love and not be loved; but 'twould be a
greater to love and be loathed. And if we new lovers guided
ourselves by what reason and experience teach us, we would see
that every beginning in anything is difficult, and that this rule
suffers no exception in the affairs of love, but rather in them is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
confirmed and strengthened the more; so that for the new lover
to complain of the hardness of his lady's rebellious breast, goes
beyond all bounds of reason. For as love is, and has to be,
voluntary, and not constrained, I ought not to complain of not
being loved by anyone I love, nor ought I to attach importance
to the burden I impose on her, telling her that she is obliged to
love me since I love her; seeing that, though the beloved person
ought, in accordance with the law of nature and with fair
courtesy, not to show herself ungrateful toward him who loves
her well, it must not for this reason be a matter of constraint
and obligation that she should respond, all in all, to her lover's
desires. For if this were so, there would be a thousand
importunate lovers who would gain by their solicitude what
would perhaps not be due to them of right; and as love has the
understanding for father, it may be that she who is well loved
by me does not find in me qualities so good as to move her and
incline her to love me. And so she is not obliged, as I have
already said, to love me, in the same way that I shall be
obliged to adore her, for I found in her what is lacking in me;
and for this reason he who is disdained ought not to complain
of his beloved, but of his fortune, which denied him the graces
that might move his lady's understanding to love him well.
And so he ought to seek, with constant services, with loving
words, with not unseasonable presence, and with practised
virtues, to improve and amend in himself the fault that nature
caused; for this is so essential a remedy that I am ready to
affirm that it will be impossible for him to fail to be loved, who,
by means so fitting, shall seek to win his lady's good-will. And
since this evil of disdain has with it the good of this cure, let
Marsilio console himself, and pity the hapless and jealous
Orfenio, in whose misfortune is enclosed the greatest that can
be imagined in those of love. Oh jealousy, disturber of the
tranquil peace of love! jealousy, knife of the firmest hopes!
I know not what he could know of lineage who made thee child
of love, since thou art so much the contrary, that, for that very
reason, love would have ceased to be love, had it begotten such
children. Oh jealousy, hypocrite and false thief! seeing that, in
order that account may be taken of thee in the world, as soon as
thou seest any spark of love born in any breast, thou seekest to
mingle with it, changing thyself to its colour, and even seekest
to usurp from it the lordship and dominion it has. Hence it
comes that as men see thee so united with love, though by thy
results thou showest that thou art not love itself, yet thou
seekest to give the ignorant man to understand that thou art
love's son, though in truth thou art born from a low suspicion, begotten
by a vile and ill-starred fear, nurtured at the breast of
false imaginings, growing up amidst vilest envies, sustained by
slanders and falsehoods. And that we may see the ruin caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
in loving hearts by this cursed affliction of raging jealousy,
when the lover is jealous, it behoves him, with the leave of
jealous lovers be it said, it behoves him, I say, to be, as he is,
traitorous, cunning, truculent, slanderous, capricious, and even
ill-bred; and so far extends the jealous rage that masters
him, that the person he loves most is the one to whom he
wishes the most ill. The jealous lover would wish that his lady
were fair for him alone, and ugly for all the world; he desires
that she may not have eyes to see more than he might wish,
nor ears to hear, nor tongue to speak; that she may be
retiring, insipid, proud and ill-mannered; and at times he even
desires, oppressed by this devilish passion, that his lady should
die, and that all should end. All these passions jealousy
begets in the minds of jealous lovers; the opposite to the
virtues which pure and simple love multiplies in true and
courteous lovers, for in the breast of a good lover are enclosed
discretion, valour, generosity, courtesy, and all that can make
him praiseworthy in the eyes of men. At the same time the
force of this cruel poison contains yet more, for there is no
antidote to preserve it, counsel to avail it, friend to aid it, nor
excuse to fit it; all this is contained in the jealous lover, and
more&mdash;every shadow terrifies him, every trifle disturbs him, and
every suspicion, false or true, undoes him. And to all this
misfortune another is added, namely, the excuses that deceive
him. And since there is no other medicine than excuses for the
disease of jealousy, and since the jealous man suffering from it
does not wish to admit them, it follows that this disease is
without remedy, and should be placed before all others. And
thus it is my opinion that Orfenio is the most afflicted, but not
the most in love; for jealousy is not the token of much love, but
of much ill-advised curiosity. And if it is a token of love, it is
like fever in a sick man, for to have it is a sign of having life,
but a life sick and diseased; and so the jealous lover has love,
but it is love sick and ill-conditioned; and moreover to be
jealous is a token of little confidence in one's own worth. And
that this is true the discreet and firm lover teaches us, who,
without reaching the darkness of jealousy, touches on the
shadows of fear, but does not enter so far into them that they
obscure the sun of his bliss; nor goes so far away from them
that they relieve him from walking in solicitude and fear; for if
this discreet fear should be wanting in the lover, I would count
him proud and over-confident. For as a common proverb of
ours says: "Who loves well, fears"; and indeed it is right that
the lover should fear, lest, as the thing he loves is extremely
good, or seemed to him to be so, it should seem the same to the
eyes of anyone who beholds it; and for the same reason love is
begotten in another who is able to disturb his love and succeeds in
so doing. The good lover fears, and let him fear, the changes of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
time, of the new events which might offer themselves to his hurt,
and lest the happy state he is enjoying may quickly end; and this
fear must be so secret, that it does not come to his tongue to
utter it, nor yet to his eyes to express it. And this fear produces
effects so contrary to those which jealousy produces in loving
breasts, that it fosters in them new desires to increase love more
if they could, to strive with all solicitude that the eyes of their
beloved should not see in them aught that is not worthy of
praise, showing themselves generous, courteous, gallant, pure
and well-bred; and as much as it is right that this virtuous fear
should be praised, so much, and even more, is it fitting that
jealousy should be blamed.'</p>

<p>The renowned Damon said this and was silent, and drew in
the wake of his own opinion the opposite ones of some who had
been listening to him, leaving all satisfied with the truth he had
shown them with such plainness. But he would not have remained
without reply, had the shepherds Orompo, Crisio,
Marsilio, and Orfenio been present at his discourse; who,
wearied by the eclogue they had recited, had gone to the house
of their friend Daranio. All being thus occupied, at the moment
the various dances were about to be renewed, they saw three
comely shepherds entering on one side of the square, who were
straightway recognised by all. They were the graceful Francenio,
the frank Lauso, and the old Arsindo, who came between
the two shepherds with a lovely garland of green laurel in his
hands; and crossing through the square, they came to a stop
where Thyrsis, Damon, Elicio, and Erastro, and all the chief
shepherds were, whom they greeted with courteous words, and
were received by them with no less courtesy, especially Lauso
by Damon, whose old and true friend he was. Compliments
having ceased, Arsindo, setting eyes on Damon and Thyrsis,
began to speak in this wise:</p>

<p>'It is the renown of your wisdom, which extends near and
far, discreet and gallant shepherds, that brings these shepherds
and myself to beg you to consent to be judges of a graceful
contest that has arisen between these two shepherds; and it is
that, the feast being over, Francenio and Lauso, who are here,
found themselves in a company of fair shepherdesses, and in
order to pass without tedium the leisure hours of the day amongst
them, they set on foot, amongst many other games, the one
which is called 'themes.' It happened then that, the turn to
propose and begin coming to one of these shepherds, fate would
have it that the shepherdess at his side and on his right hand
was, as he says, the treasurer of his soul's secrets, and the
one who was, in the opinion of all, accounted the most discreet
and most in love. Approaching then her ear, he said
to her:</p>

<p class="p1 center">"Hope doth fly and will not stay."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>The shepherdess, without being at a loss, went on, and,
each one afterwards repeating in public what he had said to the
other in secret, it was found that the shepherdess had capped
the theme by saying:</p>

<p class="p1 center">"With desire to check its flight."</p>

<p>The acuteness of this reply was praised by those who were
present; but the one to extol it most was the shepherd Lauso,
and it seemed no less good to Francenio, and so each one,
seeing that the theme and the reply were verses of the same
measure, offered to gloss them. After having done so, each one
claims that his gloss excels the other's, and to have certainty in
this, they wished to make me judge of it, but, as I knew that your
presence was gladdening our banks, I counselled them to come
to you, to whose consuminate learning and wisdom questions of
greater import might well be trusted. They have followed my
opinion, and I have gladly taken the trouble to make this
garland that it may be given as a prize to him whom you,
shepherds, decide to have glossed the better.'</p>

<p>Arsindo was silent and awaited the shepherds' reply, which
was to thank him for the good opinion he had of them and to
offer themselves to be impartial judges in that honourable
contest. With this assurance straightway Francenio once more
repeated the verses and recited his gloss, which was as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw15">
<div class="poetry">
<p><em>Hope doth fly and will not stay,<br />
With desire to check its flight.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Francenio having recited his gloss, Lauso began his, which
was as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the hour I saw thee first,</span><br />

<em>Hope doth fly and will not stay</em>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though it leaves me and doth go</span><br />

Though I could, I would not try<br />
<em>With desire to check its flight</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">As Lauso ceased reciting his gloss, Arsindo said:</p>

<p>'Here you see declared, famous Damon and Thyrsis, the
cause of the contest between these shepherds; it only remains
now that you should give the garland to him whom you should
decide to deserve it with better right; for Lauso and Francenio
are such friends, and your award will be so just that, what shall
be decided by you, they will count as right.'</p>

<p>'Do not think, Arsindo,' replied Thyrsis, 'that, though our
intellects were of the quality you imagine them to be, the
difference, if there be any, between these discreet glosses can or
ought to be decided with such haste. What I can say of them,
and what Damon will not seek to contradict, is that both are
equally good, and that the garland should be given to the
shepherdess who was the cause of so curious and praiseworthy
a contest; and, if you are satisfied with this judgment, reward
us for it by honouring the nuptials of our friend Daranio,
gladdening them with your pleasing songs, and giving lustre to
them by your honourable presence.'</p>

<p>The award of Thyrsis seemed good to all, the two shepherds
approved it and offered to do what Thyrsis bade them. But
the shepherdesses and shepherds, who knew Lauso, were
astonished to see his unfettered mind entangled in the net of love,
for straightway they saw, from the paleness of his countenance,
the silence of his tongue, and the contest he had had with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
Francenio, that his will was not as free as it was wont to be,
and they went wondering among themselves who the shepherdess
might be who had triumphed over his free heart. One thought
it was the discreet Belisa, another that it was the gay Leandra,
and some that it was the peerless Arminda, being moved to
think this by Lauso's usual practice to visit the huts of these
shepherdesses, and because each of them was likely by her
grace, worth, and beauty, to subdue other hearts as free as that
of Lauso, and it was many days ere they resolved this doubt, for
the love-sick shepherd scarce trusted to himself the secret of
his love. This being ended, straightway all the youth of the
village renewed the dances, and the rustic instruments made
pleasing music. But seeing that the sun was already hastening
his course towards the setting, the concerted voices ceased, and
all who were there determined to escort the bridal pair to their
house. And the aged Arsindo, in order to fulfil what he had
promised to Thyrsis, in the space there was between the square
and Daranio's house, to the sound of Erastro's pipe went singing
these verses:</p>

<p class="p01">A<small>RSINDO.</small></p>

<p class="p01">With the greatest pleasure Arsindo's rude verses were listened to,
and he would have gone on further with them, had not their arrival
at Daranio's house hindered it. The latter, inviting all who came
with him, remained there, save that Galatea and Florisa, through
fear lest Teolinda should be recognised by Thyrsis and Damon,
would not remain at the wedding banquet. Elicio and Erastro
would fain have accompanied Galatea to her house, but it was
not possible for her to consent to it, and so they had to remain
with their friends, and the shepherdesses, wearied with the
dances of that day, departed. And Teolinda felt more pain
than ever, seeing that at Daranio's solemn nuptials, where so
many shepherds had assisted, only her Artidoro was wanting.
With this painful thought she passed that night in company
with Galatea and Florisa, who passed it with hearts more free
and more dispassionate, until on the new day to come there
happened to them what will be told in the book which follows.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span></p>
</div>

<h2 class="nobreak">BOOK IV.</h2>


<p>With great desire the fair Teolinda awaited the coming day
to take leave of Galatea and Florisa and to finish searching by
all the banks of the Tagus for her dear Artidoro, intending to
end her life in sad and bitter solitude, if she were so poor in
fortune as to learn no news of her beloved shepherd. The
wished-for hour, then, having come, when the sun was beginning
to spread his rays over the earth, she arose, and, with tears in
her eyes, asked leave of the two shepherdesses to prosecute her
quest. They with many reasonings urged her to wait some
days more in their company, Galatea offering to her to send one
of her father's shepherds to search for Artidoro by all the banks
of the Tagus, and wherever it might be thought he could be
found. Teolinda thanked her for her offers, but would not do
what they asked of her, nay rather, after having shown in the
best words she could the obligation in which she lay to cherish
all the days of her life the favours she had received from them,
she embraced them with tender feeling and begged them not to
detain her a single hour. Then Galatea and Florisa, seeing
how vainly they wrought in thinking to detain her, charged her
to try to inform them of any incident, good or bad, that might
befall her in that loving quest, assuring her of the pleasure they
would feel at her happiness, and of their pain at her misery.
Teolinda offered to be herself the one to bring the tidings of her
good fortune, since, if they were bad, life would not have
patience to endure them, and so it would be superfluous to learn
them from her. With this promise of Teolinda Galatea and
Florisa were content, and they determined to accompany her
some distance from the place. And so, the two only taking their
crooks, and having furnished Teolinda's wallet with some
victuals for the toilsome journey, they went forth with her from
the village at a time when the sun's rays were already beginning
to strike the earth more directly and with greater force. And
having accompanied her almost half a league from the place, at
the moment they were intending to return and leave her, they
saw four men on horseback and some on foot crossing by some
broken ground which lay a little off their way. At once they
recognised them to be hunters by their attire and by the hawks
and dogs they had with them, and whilst they were looking at
them with attention to see if they knew them, they saw two
shepherdesses of gallant bearing and spirit come out from
among some thick bushes which were near the broken ground;
they had their faces muffled with two white linen kerchiefs, and
one of them, raising her voice, asked the hunters to stop, which
they did; and both coming up to one of them, who from his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
bearing and figure seemed the chief of all, seized the reins of
his horse and stood awhile talking with him without the three
shepherdesses being able to hear a word of what they said,
because of the distance from the spot which prevented it. They
only saw that after they had talked with him a little while, the
horseman dismounted, and having, as far as could be judged,
bidden those who accompanied him to return, only a boy
remaining with his horse, he took the two shepherdesses by the
hands and gradually began to enter with them into a thick wood
that was there. The three shepherdesses, Galatea, Florisa, and
Teolinda, seeing this, determined to see, if they could, who the
masked shepherdesses, and the horseman who escorted them
were. And so they agreed to go round by a part of the wood,
and see if they could place themselves in some part which might
be such as to satisfy them in what they desired. And acting in
the manner they had intended, they overtook the horseman and
the shepherdesses, and Galatea, watching through the branches
what they were doing, saw that they turned to the right and
plunged into the thickest part of the wood; and straightway
they followed them in their very footsteps until the horseman
and the shepherdesses, thinking they were well within the wood,
halted in the middle of a narrow little meadow which was
surrounded by countless thickets of bramble. Galatea and her
companions came so near that without being seen or perceived,
they saw all the horseman and the shepherdesses did and said;
and when the latter had looked on all sides to see if they could
be seen by anyone, and were assured on this point, one removed
her veil, and scarcely had she done so when she was recognised
by Teolinda, who, approaching Galatea's ear, said to her in as
low a voice as she could:</p>

<p>'This is a very strange adventure; for, unless it be that I
have lost my understanding from the grief I suffer, without any
doubt that shepherdess who has removed her veil, is the fair
Rosaura, daughter of Roselio, lord of a village near ours, and I
know not what can be the reason that has moved her to adopt
so strange a garb and to leave her district,&mdash;things which speak
so much to the detriment of her honour. But, alas, hapless one!'
added Teolinda, 'for the horseman who is with her is Grisaldo,
eldest son of rich Laurencio, who owns two villages close to this
of yours.'</p>

<p>'You speak truth, Teolinda,' replied Galatea, 'for I know him;
but be silent and keep quiet, for we shall soon see the purpose
of his coming here.'</p>

<p>Thereat Teolinda was still, and set herself attentively to watch
what Rosaura was doing. She, going up to the horseman, who
seemed about twenty years old, began to say to him with
troubled voice and angry countenance:</p>

<p>'We are in a spot, faithless man, where I may take the wished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
for vengeance for your lack of love and your neglect. But
though I took it on you in such a way that it would cost you
your life, it were little recompense for the wrong you have done
me. Here am I, unrecognised so as to recognise you, Grisaldo,
who failed to recognise my love; here is one who changed her
garb to seek for you, she who never changed her will to love
you. Consider, ungrateful and loveless one, that she who in
her own house and amongst her servants scarce could move a
step, now for your sake goes from vale to vale, and from ridge
to ridge, amidst such loneliness seeking your companionship.'</p>

<p>To all these words the fair Rosaura was uttering, the
horseman listened with his eyes fixed on the ground, and
making lines on the earth with the point of a hunting knife he
held in his hand. But Rosaura, not content with what she had
said, pursued her discourse with words such as these:</p>

<p>'Tell me, do you know peradventure, do you know, Grisaldo,
that I am she who not long ago dried your tears, stayed your
sighs, healed your pains, and above all, she who believed your
words? or perchance do you understand that you are he who
thought all the oaths that could be imagined feeble and of no
strength to assure me of the truth with which you deceived me?
Are you by chance, Grisaldo, he whose countless tears softened
the hardness of my pure heart? It is you, for indeed I see you,
and it is I, for indeed I know myself. But if you are the Grisaldo
of my belief, and I am Rosaura, as you think her to be, fulfil to me
the word you gave me, and I will give you the promise I have
never denied you. They have told me that you are marrying
Leopersia, Marcelio's daughter, so gladly that it is actually you
who are wooing her; if this news has caused me sorrow, can well
be seen by what I have done in coming to prevent its fulfilment,
and if you can confirm it, I leave the matter to your conscience.
What do you reply to this, mortal enemy of my peace? Do you
admit perchance, by your silence, that which it were right should
not pass even through your thought. Now raise your eyes and set
them on those that beheld you to their hurt; lift them and behold
her whom you are deceiving, whom you are abandoning and
forgetting. You will see, if you ponder it well, that you are
deceiving her who always spoke truth to you, you are abandoning
her who has abandoned her honour and herself to follow
you, you are forgetting her who never banished you from her
memory. Consider, Grisaldo, that in birth I am your equal,
that in wealth I am not your inferior, and that I excel you in
goodness of heart and in firmness of faith. Fulfil to me, sir, the
faith you gave me, if you are proud to be a gentleman, and are
not ashamed to be a Christian. Behold, if you do not respond
to what you owe me, I will pray Heaven to punish you, fire to
burn you, air to fail you, water to drown you, earth not to endure
you, and my kinsmen to avenge me! Behold, if you fail in your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
duty towards me, you will have in me a perpetual disturber of
your joys so long as my life shall last, and even after I am dead,
if it may be, I shall with constant shadows affright your faithless
spirit, and with frightful visions torment your deceiving eyes!
Mark that I but ask what is my own, and that by giving it you
gain what you lose by refusing it! Now move your tongue to
undeceive me for the many times you have moved it to wound
me!'</p>

<p>Saying this, the fair lady was silent, and for a short while
was waiting to see what Grisaldo replied. He, raising his face,
which up till then he had kept down, crimsoned with the shame
Rosaura's words had caused in him, with calm voice replied
to her in this wise:</p>

<p>'If I sought to deny, oh Rosaura, that I am your debtor in
more than what you say, I would likewise deny that the sunlight
is bright, and would even say that fire is cold and air solid. So
that herein I confess what I owe you, and am obliged to pay
it; but for me to confess that I can pay you as you wish is
impossible, for my father's command has forbidden it, and your
cruel disdain has rendered it impossible. Nor do I wish to call
any other witness to this truth than yourself, as one who knows
so well how many times and with what tears I begged you to
accept me as your husband, and to deign to permit me to fulfil
the word I had given you to be it. And you, for the reasons
you fancied, or because you thought it was well to respond
to Artandro's vain promises, never wished matters to come to
such an issue; but rather went on from day to day putting me
off, and making trials of my firmness, though you could make
sure of it in every way by accepting me for your own. You also
know, Rosaura, the desire my father had to settle me in life, and
the haste he showed in the matter, bringing forward the rich
and honourable marriages you know of, and how I with a
thousand excuses held aloof from his importunities, always
telling you of them, so that you should no longer defer what
suited you so well and what I desired; and that after all this I
told you one day that my father's wish was for me to marry
Leopersia, and you, on hearing Leopersia's name, in a desperate
rage told me to speak to you no more, and that I might marry
Leopersia with your blessing, or anyone I liked better. You
know also that I urged you many times to cease those jealous
frenzies, for I was yours and not Leopersia's, and that you would
never receive my excuses, nor yield to my prayers, but rather,
persevering in your obstinacy and hardness, and in favouring
Artandro, you sent to tell me that it would give you pleasure
that I should never see you more. I did what you bade me,
and, so as to have no opportunity to transgress your bidding,
seeing also that I was fulfilling that of my father, I resolved to
marry Leopersia, or at least I shall marry her to-morrow, for so it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
is agreed between her kinsmen and mine; wherefore you see,
Rosaura, how guiltless I am of the charge you lay against me,
and how late you have come to know the injustice with which
you treated me. But that you may not judge me henceforward
to be as ungrateful as you have pictured me in your fancy, see
if there is anything wherein I can satisfy your wish, for, so it be
not to marry you, I will hazard, to serve you, property, life and
honour.'</p>

<p>While Grisaldo was saying these words, the fair Rosaura kept
her eyes riveted on his face, shedding through them so many
tears that they showed full well the grief she felt in her soul.
But, seeing that Grisaldo was silent, heaving a deep and woful
sigh, she said to him:</p>

<p>'As it cannot be, oh Grisaldo, that your green years should
have a long and skilled experience of the countless accidents of
love, I do not wonder that a little disdain of mine has placed you
in the freedom you boast of; but if you knew that jealous fears are
the spurs which make love quicken his pace, you would see clearly
that those I had about Leopersia, redounded to make me love
you more. But as you made such sport of my affairs, on the
slightest pretext that you could conceive, you revealed the little
love in your breast, and confirmed my true suspicions; and in
such a way that tells me you are marrying Leopersia to-morrow.
But I assure you, before you bear her to the marriage-couch,
you must bear me to the tomb, unless, indeed, you are so cruel
as to refuse to give one to the dead body of her over whose soul
you were always absolute lord. And, that you may know clearly
and see that she who lost for you her modesty, and exposed her
honour to harm, will count it little to lose her life, this sharp
poniard which here I hold will accomplish my desperate and
honourable purpose, and will be a witness of the cruelty you
hold in that false breast of yours.'</p>

<p>And saying this she drew from her bosom a naked dagger,
and with great haste was going to plunge it in her heart, had
not Grisaldo with greater speed seized her arm, and had not
the veiled shepherdess, her companion, hurried to close with her.
Grisaldo and the shepherdess were a long while before they
took the dagger from the hands of Rosaura, who said to
Grisaldo:</p>

<p>'Permit me, traitorous foe, to end at once the tragedy of my
life, without your loveless disdain making me experience death
so often.'</p>

<p>'You shall not taste of death on my account,' replied Grisaldo,
'since I would rather that my father should fail in the word he
has given to Leopersia on my behalf, than that I should fail at
all in what I know I owe you. Calm your breast, Rosaura,
since I assure you that this breast of mine can desire naught
save what may be to your happiness.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>At these loving words of Grisaldo, Rosaura awakened from the
death of her sorrow to the life of her joy, and, without ceasing
to weep, knelt down before Grisaldo, begging for his hands in
token of the favour he did her. Grisaldo did the same, and
threw his arms round her neck; for a long while they remained
without power to say a word one to the other, both shedding
many loving tears. The veiled shepherdess, seeing her companion's
happy fortune, wearied by the fatigue she had sustained
in helping to take the dagger from Rosaura, being unable
to bear her veil any longer, took it off, disclosing a face so like
Teolinda's, that Galatea and Florisa were amazed to see it. But
Teolinda was more so, since, without being able to conceal it,
she raised her voice, saying:</p>

<p>'Oh Heavens, and what is it that I see? Is not this by
chance my sister Leonarda, the disturber of my repose? She it
is without a doubt.'</p>

<p>And, without further delay, she came out from where she was,
and with her Galatea and Florisa; and as the other shepherdess
saw Teolinda, straightway she recognised her, and with open
arms they ran one to the other, wondering to have found each
other in such a place, and at such a time and juncture. Then
Grisaldo and Rosaura, seeing what Leonarda was doing with
Teolinda, and that they had been discovered by the shepherdesses
Galatea and Florisa, arose, with no small shame that
they had been found by them in that fashion, and, drying their
tears, with reserve and courtesy received the shepherdesses,
who were at once recognised by Grisaldo. But the discreet
Galatea, in order to change into confidence the displeasure that
perchance the two loving shepherds had felt at seeing her, said
to them with that grace, with which she said everything:</p>

<p>'Be not troubled by our coming, happy Grisaldo and Rosaura,
for it will merely serve to increase your joy, since it has been
shared with one who will always have joy in serving you. Our
fortune has ordained that we should see you, and in a part
where no part of your thoughts has been concealed from us,
and since Heaven has brought them to so happy a pass, in
satisfaction thereof calm your breasts and pardon our boldness.'</p>

<p>'Never has your presence, fair Galatea,' replied Grisaldo,
'failed to give pleasure wherever it might be; and this truth
being so well known, we are rather under an obligation at sight
of you, than annoyed at your coming.'</p>

<p>With these there passed some other courteous words, far
different from those that passed between Leonarda and Teolinda,
who, after having embraced once and yet again, with tender
words, mingled with loving tears, demanded the story of each
other's adventures, filling all those that were there with amazement
at seeing them, for they resembled each other so closely, that they
could almost be called not alike, but one and the same; and had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>
it not been that Teolinda's dress was different from Leonarda's,
without a doubt Galatea and Florisa could not have distinguished
them; and then they saw with what reason Artidoro had been
deceived in thinking that Leonarda was Teolinda. But when
Florisa saw that the sun was about midway in the sky, and that
it would be well to seek some shade to protect them from its
rays, or at least to return to the village, since, as the opportunity
failed them to pasture their sheep, they ought not to be so long
in the meadow, she said to Teolinda and Leonarda:</p>

<p>'There will be time, shepherdesses, when with greater ease
you can satisfy our desires, and give us a longer account of your
thoughts, and for the present let us seek where we may spend
the rigour of the noon-tide heat that threatens us, either by a
fresh spring that is at the outlet of the valley we are leaving
behind, or in returning to the village, where Leonarda will be
treated with the kindness which you, Teolinda, have experienced
from Galatea and myself. And if I make this offer only to you,
shepherdesses, it is not because I forget Grisaldo and Rosaura,
but because it seems to me that I cannot offer to their worth and
deserving more than good-will.'</p>

<p>'This shall not be wanting in me as long as life shall last,'
replied Grisaldo, 'the will to do, shepherdess, what may be to
your service, since the kindness you show us cannot be paid
with less; but since it appears to me that it will be well to do
what you say, and because I have learnt that you are not
ignorant of what has passed between me and Rosaura, I do not
wish to waste your time or mine in referring to it, I only ask you
to be kind enough to take Rosaura in your company to your
village, whilst I prepare in mine some things which are necessary
to fulfil what our hearts desire; and in order that Rosaura
may be free from suspicion, and may never cherish suspicion of
the good faith of my intentions, with deliberate will on my
part, you being witnesses thereof, I give her my hand to be
her true husband.'</p>

<p>And, saying this, he stretched out his hand, and took fair
Rosaura's, and she was so beside herself to see what Grisaldo
did, that she scarce could answer him a word, only she allowed
him to take her hand, and a little while after said:</p>

<p>'Love had brought me, Grisaldo, my lord, to such a pass,
that, with less than you have done for me, I would remain for
ever your debtor; but since you have wished to have regard
rather for what you yourself are, than for my deserving, I shall do
what in me lies, which is to give you my soul anew in recompense
for this favour, and may Heaven give you the reward for so
welcome a kindness.'</p>

<p>'No more, no more, my friends,' said Galatea at this moment,
'for where deeds are so true, excessive compliments must find
no place. What remains is to pray Heaven to lead to a happy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
issue these beginnings, and that you may enjoy your love in a
long and beneficent peace. And as for what you say, Grisaldo,
that Rosaura should come to our village, the favour you do us
therein is so great, that we ourselves beg it of you.'</p>

<p>'So gladly will I go in your company,' said Rosaura, 'that I
know not how to enhance it more than by telling you that I will
not much regret Grisaldo's absence, when I am in your company.'</p>

<p>'Then come,' said Florisa, 'for the village is far away, and the
sun strong, and our delay in returning there conspicuous. You,
señor Grisaldo, can go and do what you wish, for in Galatea's
house you will find Rosaura, and these, or rather this one
shepherdess, for being so much alike, they ought not to be
called two.'</p>

<p>'Be it as you wish,' said Grisaldo; and, he taking Rosaura
by the hand, they all went from the wood, having agreed among
themselves that Grisaldo should on the morrow send a shepherd,
from the many his father had, to tell Rosaura what she was to
do, and that this shepherd, when sent, might be able to speak to
Galatea or to Florisa without being observed, and give the
instructions that suited best. This agreement seemed good to
all, and, having come out from the wood, Grisaldo saw that his
servant was waiting for him with the horse, and embracing
Rosaura anew, and taking leave of the shepherdesses, he went
away accompanied with tears and by Rosaura's eyes, which
never left him until they lost him from sight. As the shepherdesses
were left alone, straightway Teolinda went away with
Leonarda, in the desire to learn the cause of her coming. And
Rosaura, too, as she went, related to Galatea and to Florisa
the occasion that had moved her to take a shepherdess's dress,
and to come to look for Grisaldo, saying:</p>

<p>'It would not cause you wonder, fair shepherdesses, to see me
in this dress, if you knew how far love's mighty power extends,
which makes those who love well change not only their garb,
but will and soul, in the way that is most to its taste, and I had
lost my love for ever, had I not availed myself of the artifice of
this dress. For you must know, my friends, that, as I was in
Leonarda's village, of which my father is the lord, Grisaldo
came to it with the intention of being there some days, engaged
in the pleasing pastime of the chase; and as my father was a
great friend of his father, he arranged to receive him in the
house, and to offer him all the hospitality that he could. This
he did; and Grisaldo's coming to my house resulted in driving
me from it; for indeed, though it be at the cost of my shame, I
must tell you that the sight, the converse, and the worth of
Grisaldo made such an impression on my soul, that, without
knowing how, when he had been there a few days, I came to be
quite beside myself, and neither wished nor was able to exist
without making him master of my freedom. However, it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
not so heedlessly but that I was first satisfied that Grisaldo's
wish did not differ in any way from mine, as he gave me to
understand with many very true tokens. I then, being convinced
of this truth, and seeing how well it pleased me to have Grisaldo
for husband, came to acquiesce in his desires, and to put mine
into effect; and so, by the mediation of a handmaiden of mine,
Grisaldo and I saw each other many times in a secluded corridor,
without our being alone extending further than for us to see each
other, and for him to give me the word, which to-day he has given
me again with more force in your presence. My sad fortune
then decreed, that at the time I was enjoying so sweet a state,
there came also to visit my father a valiant gentleman from
Aragón, who was called Artandro; he being overcome, according
to what he showed, by my beauty, if I have any, sought with the
greatest solicitude that I should marry him without my father
knowing it. Meanwhile Grisaldo had sought to carry out his
purpose, and I, showing myself somewhat harsher than was necessary,
kept putting him off with words, with the intention that my
father should set about marrying me, and that then Grisaldo
should seek me for his wife; but he did not wish to do this,
since he was aware that his father's wish was to marry him to
the rich and beauteous Leopersia, for you must know her well
by the report of her riches and beauty. This came to my knowledge,
and I took the opportunity to try to make him jealous of me,
though feignedly, merely to make trial of the sincerity of his faith;
and I was so careless, or rather so simple, that thinking I gained
something thereby, I began to show some favours to Artandro.
Grisaldo, seeing this, often declared to me the pain he felt at my
dealings with Artandro, and he even informed me that if it was
not my wish that he should fulfil to me the word he had given
me, he could not fail to obey the wish of his parents. To all
these words of warning and advice I replied unadvisedly, full of
pride and arrogance, confident that the bonds which my beauty
had cast over Grisaldo's soul could not be so easily broken, or
even touched, by any other beauty. But my confidence turned
out to be much mistaken, as Grisaldo soon showed me, who,
wearied of my foolish and scornful disdain, saw fit to leave me
and to obey his father's behest. But scarcely had he gone from
my village and left my presence, when I recognised the error
into which I had fallen, and with such force did Grisaldo's
absence and jealousy of Leopersia begin to torment me that his
absence overwhelmed me and jealousy of her consumed me.
Considering then, that, if my remedy were deferred, I must
leave my life in the hands of grief, I resolved to risk losing the
lesser, which in my opinion was reputation, in order to gain the
greater, which is Grisaldo. And so, on the pretext I gave my
father, of going to see an aunt of mine, the mistress of another
village near ours, I left my home, accompanied by many of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
my father's servants, and when I reached my aunt's house,
I disclosed to her all my secret thoughts, and asked her to
be kind enough to allow me to put on this dress and come to
speak to Grisaldo, assuring her that if I did not come myself,
my affairs would have a poor issue. She consented to this on
condition that I took with me Leonarda, as one in whom she
had much confidence. I sent for her to our village and procured
this garb, and, bearing in mind some things which we two had
to do, we took leave of her eight days ago; and, though we
came to Grisaldo's village six days ago, we have never been able
to find an opportunity of speaking to him alone, as I desired,
until this morning, when I knew he was going to the chase. I
awaited him in the same place where he took leave of us, and
there has passed between us what you, friends, have seen, at
which happy issue I am as happy as it is right she should be
who desired it so much. This, shepherdesses, is the story of
my life, and if I have wearied you in telling it you, throw the
blame on the desire you had to know it, and on mine which
could not do less than satisfy you.'</p>

<p>'Nay, rather,' replied Florisa, 'we are so grateful for the
favour you have done us, that, though we may always busy
ourselves in your service we shall not escape from the debt.'</p>

<p>'I am the one who remains in debt,' answered Rosaura, 'and
who will seek to repay it as my powers may allow. But,
leaving this aside, turn your eyes, shepherdesses, and you will see
those of Teolinda and Leonarda so full of tears that they will
move yours without fail to accompany them therein.'</p>

<p>Galatea and Florisa turned to look at them, and saw that
what Rosaura said was true. What caused the weeping of the
two sisters was that after Leonarda had told her sister all that
Rosaura had related to Galatea and Florisa, she said to her:</p>

<p>'You must know, sister, that, as you were missing from our
village, it was thought that the shepherd Artidoro had taken
you away, for that same day he too was missing without taking
leave of anyone. I confirmed this opinion in my parents,
because I told them what had passed with Artidoro in the
forest. With this evidence the suspicion increased, and my
father determined to go in search of you and of Artidoro, and
in fact would have done so had not there come to our village
two days afterwards a shepherd whom all took for Artidoro
when they saw him. When the news reached my father that
your ravisher was there, straightway he came with the constables
to where the shepherd was, and they asked him if he knew you or
where he had taken you to. The shepherd denied on oath that
he had ever seen you in all his life, or that he knew what it was
they were asking him about. All that were present wondered
to see the shepherd denying that he knew you, since he had
been ten days in the village and had spoken and danced with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>
you many a time, and without any doubt all believed that
Artidoro was guilty of what was imputed to him. Without
wishing to admit his defence or to hear a word from him, they
took him to prison, where he remained without anyone speaking
to him for some days, at the end of which, when they came to
take his confession, he swore again that he did not know you,
nor in all his life had he been more than that once in that
village, and that they should consider&mdash;and this he had said at
other times&mdash;whether the Artidoro they thought he was, was
not by chance a brother of his, who resembled him so exactly
as truth would reveal when it showed them that they had
deceived themselves in taking him for Artidoro; for he was
called Galercio, son of Briseno, a native of Grisaldo's village.
And, in fact, he gave such indications and showed such proofs
that all clearly saw that he was not Artidoro, whereat they were
more amazed, saying that such a marvel as that of my likeness
to you, and Galercio's to Artidoro, had not been seen in the
world. This announcement concerning Galercio moved me to
go and see him many times where he was confined; and the
sight of him was such that I was deprived of sight, at least for
the purpose of seeing things to give me pleasure, so long as I
did not see Galercio. But the worst of it is, sister, that he went
from the village without knowing that he took with him my
freedom, nor had I the opportunity of telling it him, and so I
remained with such a grief as may be imagined, until Rosaura's
aunt sent for me for a few days, all for the purpose of coming
to accompany Rosaura; whereat I felt extreme joy, for I knew
that we were going to Galercio's village, and that there I might
make him acquainted with his debt to me. But I have been so
poor in fortune that we have been four days in his village and I
have never seen him, though I have asked for him, and they tell
me that he is in the country with his flock. I have also asked
for Artidoro, and they have told me that for some days he has
not appeared in the village; and, in order not to leave Rosaura, I
have not taken an opportunity of going to look for Galercio, from
whom it might be possible to learn news of Artidoro. This is
what has happened to me, besides what you have seen with
Grisaldo, since you have been missing, sister, from the village.'</p>

<p>Teolinda was astonished at what her sister told her; but
when she came to know that in Artidoro's village no news was
known of him, she could not restrain her tears, though she consoled
herself in part, believing that Galercio would have news of
his brother; and so she resolved to go next day to look for
Galercio wherever he might be. And having told her sister as
briefly as she could all that had happened to her since she went in
search of Artidoro, Teolinda embraced her again and returned to
where the shepherdesses were. They were walking along a little
distance from the road, in among some trees which protected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
them a little from the heat of the sun. Teolinda coming up
to them told them all that her sister had said to her concerning
the issue of her love, and the likeness of Galercio and Artidoro;
whereat they wondered not a little, though Galatea said:</p>

<p>'Whoever sees the strange likeness there is between you,
Teolinda, and your sister, cannot wonder though he sees others,
since no likeness, as I believe, is equal to yours.'</p>

<p>'There is no doubt,' replied Leonarda, 'but that the likeness
there is between Artidoro and Galercio is so great that, if it does
not surpass ours, at least it will be in no way behind it.'</p>

<p>'May Heaven please,' said Florisa, 'that as you four resemble
one another, so may you agree and be like one another in
fortune, that which fate grants to your desires being so good that
all the world may envy your joys, as it wonders at your likenesses.'</p>

<p>Teolinda would have replied to these words, had not a voice
they heard issuing from among the trees prevented it; and all
stopping to listen to it, they straightway recognised that it was
the voice of the shepherd Lauso, whereat Galatea and Florisa
felt great joy, for they wished very much to know of whom
Lauso was enamoured, and believed that what the shepherd
should sing would relieve them of this doubt, and for this
reason, without moving from where they were, they listened to
him in the greatest silence. The shepherd was seated at the
foot of a green willow, accompanied by his thoughts alone, and
by a little rebeck, to the sound of which he sang in this wise:</p>

<p>The enamoured shepherd sang no more, nor from what he
had sung could the shepherdesses come to the knowledge of
what they desired, for, though Lauso named Silena in his song,
the shepherdess was not known by this name; and so they
imagined that, as Lauso had gone through many parts of Spain,
and even of all Asia and Europe, it would be some foreign
shepherdess who had subdued his free will; but when they considered
again that they had seen him a few days before triumphing
in his freedom and making mock of lovers, they believed
beyond a doubt, that under a feigned name he was celebrating
some well-known shepherdess whom he had made mistress of
his thoughts; and so, without being satisfied in their suspicion,
they went towards the village, leaving the shepherd in the same
place where he was. But they had not gone far when they saw
coming from a distance some shepherds who were straightway
recognised, for they were Thyrsis, Damon, Elicio, Erastro,
Arsindo, Francenio, Crisio, Orompo, Daranio, Orfenio, and
Marsilio, with all the chief shepherds of the village, and among
them, the loveless Lenio with the hapless Silerio, who came to
pass the noon-tide heat at the spring of slates, in the shade
made in that place by the interwoven branches of the dense
green trees. Before the shepherds approached, Teolinda,
Leonarda and Rosaura took care each to veil herself with a
white cloth that they might not be recognised by Thyrsis and
Damon. The shepherds approached, offering courteous greetings
to the shepherdesses, inviting them to consent to spend
the noon-tide heat in their company; but Galatea excused herself
by saying that the strange shepherdesses who came with
her, must needs go to the village; therewith she took leave of
them, drawing after her the souls of Elicio and Erastro, and the
veiled shepherdesses likewise the desires of all who were there
to know them. They betook themselves to the village, and the
shepherds to the cool spring, but before they reached there,
Silerio took leave of all, asking permission to return to his
hermitage; and though Thyrsis, Damon, Elicio, and Erastro
begged him to remain with them for that day, they could not
prevail with him; nay rather he embraced them all and took
his leave, charging and begging Erastro not to fail to visit him
every time he passed by his hermitage. Erastro promised it
him, and therewith, he turned aside, and accompanied by his
constant sorrow, returned to the solitude of his hermitage,
leaving the shepherds not without grief to see the straitness of
life he had chosen when his years were yet green; but it was
felt most among those who knew him and were acquainted with
the quality and worth of his person. When the shepherds came
to the spring, they found there three gentlemen and two fair
ladies who were journeying, and being wearied with fatigue and
invited by the pleasing and cool spot, it seemed good to them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
to leave the road they were following, and spend there the
sultry hours of the noon-tide heat. There came with them
some servants, so that they showed by their appearance that
they were persons of quality. The shepherds, when they saw
them, would have left the spot free to them; but one of the
gentlemen, who seemed the chief, seeing that the shepherds in
their courtesy wished to go to another place, said to them:</p>

<p>'If it was by chance your pleasure, gallant shepherds, to
spend the noon-tide heat in this delightful spot, let not our
company hinder you from it, but rather do us the favour of
increasing our pleasure with your company, since your noble
disposition and manner promise no less: and, the place being,
as it is, so adapted for a greater number of people, you will
grieve me and these ladies, if you do not agree to what I ask
you in their name and mine.'</p>

<p>'By doing, sir, what you bid us,' replied Elicio, 'we shall
fulfil our desire, which did not for the moment extend beyond
coming to this place to spend here in pleasant converse the
tedious hours of the noon-tide heat; and, though our purpose
were different, we would change it merely to do what you ask.'</p>

<p>'I am grateful,' replied the gentleman, 'for tokens of such
good-will, and in order that I may be the more assured of it
and gratified thereby, be seated, shepherds, around this cool
spring, where with some things which these ladies have with
them for refreshment by the way, you may awake your thirst
and quench it in the cool waters this clear spring offers us.'</p>

<p>All did so, constrained by his fair courtesy. Up to this point
the ladies had kept their faces covered with two rich veils; but,
seeing that the shepherds were remaining, they revealed themselves,
revealing a beauty so strange that it caused great
astonishment in all who saw it, for it seemed to them that after
Galatea's there could be on earth no other beauty to match it.
The two ladies were equally beautiful, though one of them, who
seemed the older, excelled the smaller one in a certain grace
and spirit. All being seated then, and at their ease, the second
gentleman, who up till then had spoken nothing, said:</p>

<p>'When I stop to consider, amiable shepherds, the advantage your
humble shepherds' ways have over the proud ways of the courtier,
I cannot fail to have pity for myself and honourable envy of you.'</p>

<p>'Why do you say that, friend Darinto?' said the other
gentleman.</p>

<p>'I say it, sir,' replied the former, 'because I see with what
care you and I, and those who follow our ways, seek to adorn
our persons, to nourish our bodies, and to increase our property,
and how little it comes to profit us, since the purple, the gold,
the brocade, and our faces are faded from badly digested
victuals, eaten at odd hours, and as costly as they are wasteful,
and since they adorn us in no way, nor beautify us, nor suffice to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
make us look better in the eyes of those who behold us. And
all this you can see is different in those who follow the rustic
pursuits of the field, proving it by those you have before you,
who, it might be and even is the case, have been nourished and
are nourished on simple victuals, in every way different from the
wasteful composition of ours. And, besides, see the tan of their
faces, which promises a state of health more perfect than the
sickly pallor of ours, and how well a jerkin of white wool, a grey
bonnet and some gaiters of whatsoever colour suit their robust
and supple limbs; whereby they must appear more handsome
in the eyes of their shepherdesses, than gay courtiers in
those of modest ladies. What could I say to you, then, if I
were minded, of the simplicity of their life, the sincerity of their
character, and the purity of their love? I say no more to you,
save that what I know of the shepherd's life has such power
with me, that gladly would I exchange mine for it.'</p>

<p>'We shepherds are all indebted to you,' said Elicio, 'for the
good opinion you have of us, but nevertheless I can tell you that
in our country life there are as many slippery places and toils
as are contained in your courtier's life.'</p>

<p>'I cannot but agree with what you say,' replied Darinto,
'for indeed it is well known that our life on earth is a war; but
after all in the shepherd's life there is less of it than in that of
the town, for it is more free from causes that may move and
disquiet the spirit.'</p>

<p>'How well agrees with your opinion, Darinto,' said Damon,
'that of a shepherd friend of mine, called Lauso, who, after
having spent some years in a courtier's pursuits, and some
others in the toilsome pursuits of cruel Mars, has at last been
brought to the poverty of our country life, and before he came
to it, he showed that he much desired it, as appears by a song
he composed and sent to the famous Larsileo, who has a long
and practised experience in affairs of the court; and, because
I saw fit to do so, I committed it all to memory, and would even
repeat it to you, if I thought that time would permit it, and that
it would not weary you to listen to it.'</p>

<p>'Nothing will give us greater pleasure than to listen to you,
discreet Damon,' replied Darinto, calling Damon by his name,
for he already knew it from having heard the other shepherds,
his friends, name him; 'and so I for my part beg you to repeat
to us Lauso's song, for since it is composed, as you say, to suit
my case, and you have committed it to memory, it will be
impossible for it not to be good.'</p>

<p>Damon began to repent of what he had said, and sought to
escape from his promise; but the gentlemen and ladies and all
the shepherds begged it of him so much, that he could not
escape repeating it. And so, having composed himself a little,
with admirable grace and charm he spoke in this wise:</p>

<p class="p01">'This, gentlemen, is Lauso's song,' said Damon on finishing
it; 'which was as much extolled by Larsileo as it was well
received by those who saw it at the time.'</p>

<p>'With reason you can say so,' replied Darinto, 'since its
truth and workmanship are worthy of just praises.'</p>

<p>'These are the songs to my taste,' said the loveless Lenio at
this moment, 'and not those which every instant come to my
ears, full of a thousand simple amorous conceits, so badly
arranged and involved, that I will venture to swear that there
are some, which neither the hearer, however discreet he be, can
comprehend, nor the composer understand. But no less wearisome
are others, which entangle themselves in giving praises to
Cupid, and in exaggerating his powers, his worth, his wonders
and miracles, making him lord of Heaven and earth, giving him
a thousand other attributes of might, dominion and lordship;
and what wearies me more than those who make them, is that,
when they speak of love, they mean a someone undefined,
whom they call Cupid, the very meaning of whose name
declares to us what he is, namely a vain and sensual appetite,
worthy of all reproof.'</p>

<p>The loveless Lenio spoke, and indeed he was certain to end in,
speaking ill of love; but as nearly all who were there knew his
disposition, they did not give much heed to his reasonings,
except Erastro, who said to him:</p>

<p>'Do you think, Lenio, by chance, that you are always speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>ing
to a simple Erastro, who cannot contradict your opinions, or
reply to your arguments? Then I wish to warn you that it will be
wise for you to be silent for the present, or at least to discuss
other matters than speaking ill of love, unless indeed you would
have Thyrsis's and Damon's discretion and learning restoring
your sight, from the blindness in which you are, and showing
you clearly what they understand, and what you should understand,
of love and of its affairs.'</p>

<p>'What will they be able to tell me that I do not know?' said
Lenio, 'or what shall I be able to reply to them but what they
are ignorant of?'</p>

<p>'This is pride, Lenio,' replied Elicio, 'and therein you show
how far you go from the path of love's truth, and that you guide
yourself more by the pole-star of your opinion and fancy, than
by that whereby you should be guided, namely that of truth and
experience.'</p>

<p>'Nay rather by reason of the great experience I have of its
works,' replied Lenio, 'am I as opposed to it as I show, and
shall show so long as my life shall last.'</p>

<p>'On what do you base your reasoning?' said Thyrsis.</p>

<p>'On what, shepherd?' answered Lenio; 'on this, that by the
effects they have I know how evil is the cause that produces
them.'</p>

<p>'What are the effects of love that you count so evil?' replied
Thyrsis.</p>

<p>'I will tell you them, if you listen to me with attention,' said
Lenio; 'but I would not have my discourse weary the ears of
those who are present, since they can spend the time in different
and more pleasurable converse.'</p>

<p>'There will be nothing that could be more so to us,' said
Darinto, 'than to hear a discussion of this topic, especially
between persons who will know so well how to defend their
opinion: and so for my part, if these shepherds on theirs do not
hinder it, I beg you, Lenio, to continue the discourse you have
begun.'</p>

<p>'That will I do readily,' answered Lenio, 'for I think I shall
show clearly therein what a strong reason compels me to follow
the opinion I do follow, and to blame any other that may be
opposed to mine.'</p>

<p>'Begin then, oh Lenio,' said Damon, 'for you will not hold
it longer than my companion Thyrsis will take to explain his.'</p>

<p>At this moment, whilst Lenio was preparing to utter his
reproofs against love, there came to the spring the venerable
Aurelio, Galatea's father, with some shepherds, and with him
came also Galatea and Florisa, with the three veiled shepherdesses,
Rosaura, Teolinda, and Leonarda, whom he had met at
the entrance of the village, and, learning from them of the
gathering of shepherds there was at the spring of slates, caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
to turn back at his request, the strange shepherdesses trusting
that by reason of their veils they would not be recognised by
anyone. All rose to receive Aurelio and the shepherdesses,
these latter seating themselves by the ladies, Aurelio and the
shepherds by the other shepherds. But when the ladies saw
Galatea's remarkable beauty, they were so astonished that they
could not keep their eyes from looking at her. Nor was
Galatea less so at their beauty, especially at that of her who
seemed the older. There passed between them some words of
courtesy, but everything ceased when they learnt what was
agreed between the discreet Thyrsis and the loveless Lenio;
whereat the venerable Aurelio was infinitely rejoiced, for he
desired very much to see that assembly, and to hear that discussion,
and all the more when Lenio would have someone who
could answer him so well; and so, without waiting further,
Lenio, seating himself on the trunk of a felled elm-tree, in a
voice at first low, and then full-sounding, began to speak in this
wise:</p>

<p>L<small>ENIO.</small> 'Already I almost guess, worthy and discreet company,
how even now in your understanding you are judging me
as bold and rash, since with the little intellect and less experience
which the rustic life, in which I have been nurtured for some
time, can promise, I am willing to hold a contest in a matter so
difficult as this with the famous Thyrsis, whose nurture in
famous academies, and whose profound studies, can assure
naught to my pretensions save certain failure. But confident that
at times the force of natural genius, adorned with some little
experience, is wont to discover new paths with which one makes
easy sciences acquired during long years, I wish to make bold
to-day to show in public the reasons which have moved me to be
such an enemy to love, that I had deserved thereby to gain the
appellation of loveless; and though nothing else would have
moved me to do this, save your behest, I would not excuse
myself from doing it; all the more that the glory will not be
slight which I have to gain hereby, though I should lose in the
enterprise, since after all fame will say that I had the spirit to
compete with the renowned Thyrsis. And so on this understanding,
without wishing to be favoured except by the reason
that I have on my side, it alone do I invoke and pray to give
such strength to my words and arguments that there may
appear in both of them the reason I have for being such an
enemy to love as I proclaim. Love, then, as I have heard my
elders say, is a desire for beauty; and this definition, amongst
many others, those give it that have advanced farthest in this
question. Then, if it be granted me, that love is desire for
beauty, it must necessarily be granted me that such as is
the beauty which is loved, will be the love with which it is loved.
And because beauty is of two kinds, corporeal and incorporeal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
the love which loves corporeal beauty for its ultimate goal, such
a love as this cannot be good, and this is the love whose enemy
I am; but as corporeal beauty is divided likewise into two parts,
namely into living bodies and dead bodies, there can also be a
love of corporeal beauty which may be good. The one part of
corporeal beauty is shown in living bodies of men and women,
and this consists in all the parts of the body being good in
themselves, and all together making one perfect whole, and
forming a body proportioned in limbs and in pleasantness of
hue. The other beauty of the corporeal part which is not alive,
consists in pictures, statues and buildings; which beauty can be
loved without the love with which it is loved being blameworthy.
Incorporeal beauty is divided also into two parts, the virtues
and the sciences of the soul; and the love which cleaves to
virtue must necessarily be good, and likewise that which
cleaves to virtuous sciences and agreeable studies. Then,
as these two kinds of beauty are the cause which begets
love in our breasts, it follows that whether love be good or bad,
depends upon loving the one or the other: but, as incorporeal
beauty is viewed with the pure and clear eyes of the understanding,
and corporeal beauty is regarded with the corporeal eyes,
clouded and blind, in comparison with the incorporeal, and as
the eyes of the body are quicker to regard the present corporeal
beauty which pleases, than those of the understanding to view
the absent incorporeal beauty which glorifies, it follows that
mortals more usually love the fading and mortal beauty which
destroys them than the rare and divine beauty which makes
them better. Then from this love, or from desiring corporeal
beauty, have arisen, arise, and will arise in the world desolation
of cities, ruin of states, destruction of empires, and deaths of
friends; and when this, as is generally the case, does not
happen, what greater woes, what more grievous torments, what
fire, what jealousy, what pains, what deaths, can the human
understanding imagine which can be compared to those the
wretched lover suffers? And the cause of this is that, as the
lover's whole happiness depends upon enjoying the beauty he
desires, and this beauty cannot be possessed and enjoyed fully,
that inability to reach the goal which is desired, begets in him
sighs, tears, complaints, and dejection. It is manifest and clear
then that it is true that the beauty of which I speak, cannot be
enjoyed perfectly and fully, because it is not in the power of
man to enjoy completely a thing which is outside of him and
not wholly his; because external things, it is well known, are
always under the control of that which we call fortune or chance,
and not in the power of our free-will, and so it results that where
there is love there is sorrow; and he who would deny this, would
likewise deny that the sun is bright and that fire burns. But
that we may come the more easily to the knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span>
bitterness that love contains, the truth I follow will be clearly
seen by running over the passions of the mind. The passions
of the mind, as you know best, discreet gentlemen and
shepherds, are four universal ones, and no more. Immoderate
desire, much joy, great fear for future miseries, great
sorrow for present calamities; these passions, being, as it were,
contrary winds which disturb the tranquillity of the soul,
are called by a more appropriate term disturbances; and of
these disturbances the first is proper to love, since love is
nothing else save desire; and so desire is the beginning and
origin of all our passions, from which they issue as every stream
from its source. Hence it comes that every time desire for
something is kindled in our hearts, straightway it moves us to
follow it and seek it, and in seeking it and following it, it leads
us to a thousand disordered ends. This desire it is which
incites the brother to seek his beloved sister's abominable
embraces, the stepmother her step-son's, and what is worst, the
very father his own daughter's; this desire it is that bears our
thoughts to grievous perils. Nor does it avail that we oppose it
with the reason, for, though we clearly recognise our hurt, we
cannot, on that account, withdraw from it; and love does not
content itself with keeping us intent on one wish, but rather, as
from the desire of things all the passions arise, as has already
been said, so from the first desire that arises in us, a thousand
others are derived; and these are in lovers no less various than
infinite, and though they well-nigh always look to one goal only,
yet, as the objects are various, and various the fortune of those
in love with each, without any doubt desire takes various forms.
There are some who, to reach the attainment of what they
desire, put all their strength on one course, in which, alas, what
great hardships are encountered, how often they fall, what sharp
thorns torture their feet, and how often strength and breath are
lost before they attain what they seek! There are some others
who are possessors of the thing beloved, and neither desire nor
think of aught else save to remain in that state, and, having
their thoughts busied about this alone, and on this alone spending
all their toil and time, are wretched amidst happiness, poor
amidst wealth, and unfortunate amidst good fortune. Others
who are no longer in possession of their treasure, seek to return
to it, employing for the purpose a thousand prayers, a thousand
promises, a thousand conditions, countless tears, and at last,
busying themselves with these woes, they bring themselves to
the pass of losing their life. But these torments are not seen at
the entry of the first desires, for then deceitful love shows us a
path whereby we may enter, in appearance broad and spacious,
which afterwards gradually closes in in such a manner that no
way offers itself to return or go forward; and so the wretched
lovers, deceived and betrayed by a sweet and false smile, by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
mere turn of the eye, by two stammered words which beget in
their breasts a false and feeble hope, dash straightway to go
after it, goaded by desire, and afterwards, in a short space and
in a few days, finding the path of their cure closed, and the way
of their pleasure obstructed, turn to bedew their faces with
tears, to disturb the air with sighs, to weary the ears with woeful
complaints; and the worst is, that if perchance with their tears,
their sighs, and their complaints they cannot come to the goal of
their desire, straightway they change their manner and seek to
attain by bad means what they cannot by good. Hence arise
hatreds, angers, deaths as well of friends as of enemies. For this
cause it has been seen and is seen at every moment that tender
and delicate women set themselves to do things so strange and
rash that even to imagine them inspires terror. Therefore the
holy marriage-bed is seen bathed in crimson blood, now of the
sad unheeding wife, now of the incautious and careless husband.
To come to the goal of this desire brother is traitor to brother,
father to son, and friend to friend. It originates feuds,
tramples on respect, transgresses laws, forgets duties, and
seduces kinswomen. But in order that it may be clearly seen
how great the misery of lovers is, it is already known that no
appetite has such strength in us, nor carries us with such force
to the object in view as that which is urged on by the spurs of
love. Hence it comes that no happiness or contentment passes
so much beyond the due bounds as that of the lover when he
comes to attain any one of the things he desires; and this is
evident, for what person of judgment will there be, save the
lover, who will reckon his highest joy a touch of his mistress's
hand, a little ring of hers, a short loving glance, and other
similar things of as small account as a dispassionate understanding
holds them? And not by reason of these abundant
pleasures which lovers in their judgment gain, must it be said
that they are happy and fortunate; for there is no contentment
of theirs that does not come accompanied by innumerable
displeasures and disgusts, wherewith love dilutes them and
disturbs them, and never did amorous glory reach the pitch
reached and attained by pain. So evil is the happiness of lovers
that it draws them out of themselves, making them careless and
foolish; for, as they set their whole intent and strength to
maintain themselves in that pleasant state they fancy themselves
to be in, they neglect everything else, whereby no small harm
overtakes them, as well of property, as of honour and life.
Then, in exchange for what I have said, they even make themselves
slaves of a thousand pangs, and enemies of themselves.
What then, when it happens that, in the midst of the course of
their pleasures, the cold steel of the heavy lance of jealousy
touches them? Then the sky is darkened for them, the air is
disturbed, and all the elements turn against them. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
have nothing from which to hope for contentment, since the
attainment of the end they desire cannot give it them. Then
appear ceaseless dread, unfailing despair, sharp suspicions,
varying thoughts, care without gain, false laughter and true
sorrow, with a thousand other strange and terrible sensations
which consume them and affright them. All the actions of the
beloved object distress them, if she looks, if she laughs, if she
turns away or comes back, if she is silent, if she speaks; and in
a word all the graces that moved him to love well, are the very
ones which torture the jealous lover. And who does not know
that if fortune does not favour with full hands the beginnings of
love and with speedy diligence lead them to a sweet end, how
costly to the lover are any other means the luckless one employs
to attain his purpose? What tears he sheds, what sighs he
scatters, how many letters he writes, how many nights he does
not sleep, how many and what contrary thoughts assail him,
how many suspicions distress him and fears surprise him? Is
there by chance a Tantalus who feels more distress, set between
the waters and the apple-tree, than that which the wretched
lover feels placed between fear and hope? The services of the
lover out of favour are the pitchers of Danaus's daughters,
drained so fruitlessly that they never come to attain the least
part of their purpose. Is there eagle that so destroys the bowels
of Tityus as jealousy destroys and gnaws those of the jealous
lover? Is there rock that weighs down so much the shoulders
of Sisyphus as love unceasingly weighs down the thoughts of
those in love? Is there wheel of Ixion that more quickly turns
and torments than the quick varying fancies of irresolute lovers?
Is there a Minos or Rhadamanthus who so punishes and
oppresses the luckless condemned souls as love punishes and
oppresses the loving breast which is subject to his unendurable
power? There is not a cruel Megæra, nor raging Tisiphone,
nor avenging Alecto, who so illtreat the soul in which they
enclose themselves, as this fury, this desire, illtreats those hapless
ones who recognise it as lord, and bow before it as vassals,
who, to give some excuse for the follies they commit, say&mdash;or at
least the ancient heathens said&mdash;that that instinct which incites
and moves the lover to love another's life more than his own,
was a god, to whom they gave the name of Cupid, and so, being
constrained by his godhead, they could not fail to follow and go
after what he willed. They were moved to say this, and to give
the name of god to this desire by seeing the supernatural effects
it produces in lovers. Without doubt it seems a supernatural
thing for a lover at the same moment to be timorous and confident,
to burn away from his beloved and grow cold when
nearer her, to be dumb when speaking much, and speaking
much when dumb. It is likewise a strange thing to follow one
who shuns me, to praise one who reproaches me, to utter words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
to one who does not listen to me, to serve an ungrateful one,
and to hope in one who never promises nor can give aught that
is good. Oh bitter sweetness, oh poisonous medicine of sick
lovers, oh sad joy, oh flower of love, that dost indicate no fruit,
save that of tardy repentance! These are the effects of this
fancied god, these are his deeds and wondrous works; and
indeed it can also be seen in the picture by which they represented
this vain god of theirs, how vainly they acted; they
painted him as a boy, naked, winged, his eyes bandaged, with
bow and arrows in his hands, to give us to understand, amongst
other things, that, when a man is in love, he assumes again the
character of a simple and capricious boy, who is blind in his
aims, light in his thoughts, cruel in his deeds, naked and poor
in the riches of the understanding. They said likewise that
amongst his arrows he had two, the one of lead and the other
of gold, with which he produced different effects; for the leaden
one begot hatred in the breasts it touched, and the golden one
increase of love in those it wounded, merely to tell us that it is
rich gold that causes love, and poor lead abhorrence. And for
this reason poets do not sing in vain of Atalanta vanquished by
three lovely golden apples; and of fair Danae, made pregnant
by the golden rain; and of pious Æneas descending to hell
with the golden branch in his hand; in a word, gold and gifts
are one of the strongest arrows which love has; and the one
with which he subdues most hearts; quite the contrary to the
one of lead, a metal low and despised, as poverty is, which
rather begets hatred and abhorrence where it comes, than any
kind of benevolence. But if the reasons spoken by me so far do
not suffice to persuade you of the reason I have for being on
bad terms with this treacherous love, which I am discussing
to-day, observe its effects in some true examples from the past,
and you will see, as I see, that he who does not attain to the
truth I follow does not see nor has he eyes of understanding.
Let us see then&mdash;what but this love is it which made righteous
Lot break his chaste purpose and violate his own daughters?
This it is without doubt that made the chosen David be an
adulterer and a murderer; that forced the lustful Ammon to
seek the infamous embraces of Tamar, his beloved sister; that
placed the head of mighty Samson in the traitorous lap of
Delilah, whereby he lost his strength, his people lost their protection,
and at last he and many others their lives. This it was
that moved Herod's tongue to promise to the dancing girl the
head of the Fore-runner of Life; this makes one doubt of the
salvation of the wisest and richest king of kings, and even of all
mankind. This brought down the strong arms of famous Hercules,
accustomed to wield the weighty club, to turn a tiny
spindle and to busy themselves in feminine tasks. This made
the raging and loving Medea scatter through the air the tender<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>
limbs of her little brother; this cut out the tongue of Procne,
Arachne and Hippolytus, made Pasiphae infamous, destroyed
Troy, and slew Ægisthus. This caused the works of new
Carthage once begun to be stayed, and her first queen to pierce
her chaste breast with a sharp sword. This placed in the hands
of the fair and famous Sophonisba, the vial of deadly poison
which ended her life. This robbed valiant Turnus of life,
Tarquin of kingdom, Mark Antony of power, and his mistress
of life and honour. This finally handed our Spain over to the
barbarous fury of the children of Hagar, called to avenge the
disordered love of the wretched Roderick. But, because I think
that night will cover us with its shade before I finish bringing to
your memory the examples that offer themselves to mine, of the
exploits that love has performed, and is performing every day in
the world, I do not wish to go on with them, nor yet with the discourse
I have begun, in order to give an opportunity for the famous
Thyrsis to reply to me, begging you first, gentlemen, not to be
wearied by hearing a song which I composed some days ago in
reproach of this my foe. If I remember rightly, it runs in this way:</p>

<p class="p01">With this song the loveless Lenio ended his reasoning,
leaving some of those that were present full of wonder at both,
especially the gentlemen, for it seemed to them that what Lenio
had said seemed of more worth than was usual with a shepherd's
intellect. And with great desire and attention they were awaiting
Thyrsis's reply, all promising themselves in fancy that it would
without any doubt excel Lenio's, for Thyrsis exceeded him in age
and experience, and in the studies most generally pursued, and
this likewise reassured them, for they desired that Lenio's loveless
opinion should not prevail. It is indeed true that the hapless
Teolinda, the loving Leonarda, the fair Rosaura, and even the
lady who came with Darinto and his companion, clearly saw
depicted in Lenio's discourse a thousand points of the course of
their loves; and this was when he came to treat of tears and
sighs, and of how dearly the joys of love were bought. Only
the fair Galatea and the discreet Florisa did not count in this,
for up till then love had not taken count of their fair rebellious
breasts, and so they were eager only to hear the acuteness with
which the two famous shepherds disputed, without seeing in
their free will any of the effects of love they were hearing of.
But Thyrsis's will being to reduce to better limits the loveless
shepherds opinion, without waiting to be asked, the minds of
the bystanders hanging on his lips, he set himself in front of
Lenio, and with agreeable and elevated tone began to speak in
this wise:</p>

<p>T<small>HYRSIS.</small> 'If the acuteness of your fair intellect, loveless
shepherd, did not assure me that with ease it can attain the
truth, from which it finds itself so far at present, rather than put
myself to the trouble of contradicting your opinion, I would
leave you in it, as a punishment for your unjust words. But
because those you have uttered in blame of love show me the
good germs you possess by which you may be brought to a
better purpose, I do not wish by my silence to leave those who
hear us scandalised, love despised, and you pertinacious and
vainglorious; and so, being aided by Love on whom I call, I
think in a few words to show how different are his works and
effects from those you have declared about him, speaking only
of the love you mean, which you defined when you said that it
was a desire for beauty, and likewise declared what beauty was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
and a little later you closely examined all the effects which the
love of which you speak produced in loving breasts, finally
strengthening your views with various unhappy events caused
by love. And though the definition you made of love may be
the one most generally given, yet it is not so much so but that
it may be contradicted; for love and desire are two different
things, since not everything that is loved is desired, nor everything
that is desired loved. The reasoning is clear in the case of
all things that are possessed, for then it cannot be said that they
are desired, but that they are loved: thus, he who has health will
not say that he desires health, but that he loves it; and he who
has children cannot say that he desires children, but that he
loves his children; nor yet can it be said of the things that are
desired that they are loved, as of the death of enemies, which is
desired and not loved. And so for this reason love and desire
come to be different passions of the will. The truth is that love
is the father of desire, and amongst other definitions which are
given of love this is one. Love is that first change which we
feel caused in our mind by the appetite which moves us and
draws us to itself, delighting and pleasing us; and that pleasure
begets motion in the soul, which motion is called desire, and, in
short, desire is a motion of the appetite in regard to what is
loved, and a wish for that which is possessed, and its object is
happiness. And as there are found different species of desires,
and love is a species of desire which looks to and regards the
happiness which is called fair, yet for a clearer definition and
division of love it must be understood that it is divided into
three kinds, chaste love, useful love, and delectable love.
And to these three forms of love are reduced all the kinds of
loving and desiring that can exist in our will: for the chaste
love regards the things of Heaven, eternal and divine; the useful,
the things of earth, full of joy and doomed to perish, such
as wealth, powers, and lordships; the delectable, things giving
delight and pleasure, as the living corporeal beauties of which
you, Lenio, spoke. And each form of these loves of which I
have spoken ought not to be blamed by any tongue, for the
chaste love ever was, is and must be spotless, simple, pure and
divine, finding rest and repose in God alone. Profitable
love, being, as it is, natural, ought not to be condemned, still less
the delectable, for it is more natural than the profitable. That
these two forms of love are natural in us, experience shows us,
for as soon as our daring first parent transgressed the divine
commandment, and from lord was made a servant, and from
freeman a slave, straightway he knew the misery into which he
had fallen, and the poverty in which he was. And so he
at once took the leaves of trees to cover him, and sweated
and toiled, breaking the earth to sustain himself, and to live
with the least discomfort possible; and thereafter, obeying his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
God therein better than in aught else, he sought to have children,
and in them to perpetuate and delight the human race. And as
by his disobedience death entered into him, and through him
into all his descendants, so we inherit at the same time all his
affections and passions, as we inherit his very nature; and as he
sought to remedy his necessity and poverty, so we cannot fail to
seek and desire to remedy ours. And hence springs the love we
have for things useful to human life; and the more we gain of
them, the more it seems to us we remedy our want. And by the
same reasoning we inherit the desire of perpetuating ourselves in
our children; and from this desire follows that, which we have, to
enjoy living corporeal beauty, as the only true means which lead
such desires to a happy end. So that this delectable love, alone
and without mixture of any other accident, is worthy rather of
praise than of blame. And this is the love, which you, Lenio,
hold for enemy; and the cause is that you do not understand it,
nor know it, for you have never seen it alone, and in its own
shape, but always accompanied by pernicious, lascivious and
ill-placed desires. And this is not the fault of love, which is
always good, but of the accidents which come to it; as we see
happening in some copious stream, that has its birth from some
clear and limpid spring, which is ever supplying to it clear cool
waters, and a little while after it leaves its stainless mother, its
sweet and crystalline waters are changed to bitter and turbid, by
reason of the many stained brooks, which join it on either side.
Hence this first motion, love or desire as you would call it, cannot
arise except from a good beginning; and truly among good
beginnings is the knowledge of beauty, which, once recognised as
such, it seems well-nigh impossible to avoid loving. And beauty
has such power to move our minds, that it alone caused the ancient
philosophers (blind and without the light of faith to guide them),
led by natural reason, and attracted by the beauty they beheld
in the starry heavens, and in the mechanism and roundness of the
earth, marvelling at such harmony and beauty, to pursue investigations
with the understanding, making a ladder by these second
causes to reach the first cause of causes; and they recognised
that there was one only beginning without beginning of all
things. But that which made them wonder most and raise
their thoughts, was to see the frame of man so well-ordered,
so perfect and so beautiful, that they came to call him a
world in little; and so it is true that in all the works made by
God's steward, Nature, nothing is of such excellence, nor reveals
more the greatness and wisdom of its Maker. For in the form
and frame of man is summed up and enclosed the beauty which is
distributed in all the other parts of it; and hence it arises that
this beauty, when recognised, is loved, and as all beauty displays
itself most and is most resplendent in the face, as soon as a
beautiful face is seen, it summons and draws the will to love it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>'Hence it follows that as the faces of women so much excel in
beauty those of men, it is they who are the more loved, served
and courted by us, as the object in which dwells the beauty that
is naturally more pleasing to our sight. But our Maker and
Creator, seeing that it is the proper nature of our soul to be for
ever in perpetual motion and desire, for it cannot find rest save
in God, as in its proper centre, willed, so that it might not rush
with loosened rein to desire things empty and doomed to perish,
and this without taking from it the liberty of free-will, to set
over its three powers an alert sentinel, who should warn it
against the dangers that opposed it and the enemies that
persecuted it; this was reason, which corrects and curbs our
inordinate desires. And seeing likewise that human beauty
must needs draw after it our passions and inclinations, while it
did not seem good to Him to take away from us this desire, at
least He wished to temper it and correct it, ordaining the holy
yoke of matrimony, beneath which most of the natural joys and
pleasures of love are lawful and fitting for man and woman.
By these two remedies imposed by the divine hand comes to be
tempered the excess there can be in the natural love which you,
Lenio, blame, which love is of itself so good that if it were
lacking in us, the world and we would end. In this very love
of which I am speaking are summed up all the virtues, for love
is moderation, since the lover, according to the chaste wish of
the beloved object, tempers his own; it is fortitude, for the
lover can endure any adversity for the love of the one who loves
him; it is justice, for with it he serves her who loves well,
reason itself forcing him to it; it is prudence, for love is adorned
with all wisdom. But I ask you, oh Lenio, you who have said
that love is the cause of the ruin of empires, of the destruction
of cities, of the deaths of friends, of sacrileges committed, the
deviser of treasons, the transgressor of laws&mdash;I ask you, I say,
to tell me, what praiseworthy thing there is to-day in the world,
however good it be, the use of which cannot be changed into
evil. Let philosophy be condemned, for often it discovers our
faults, and many philosophers have been wicked; let the works
of the heroic poets be burned, for with their satires and verses
they reprehend vices; let medicine be blamed, for men discover
poisons; let eloquence be called useless, for at times it has been
so arrogant that it has placed in doubt the recognised truth;
let not arms be forged, for robbers and murderers use them;
let not houses be built, for they can fall upon the inhabitants;
let variety of victuals be prohibited, for they are wont to be a
cause of illness; let no one seek to have children, for Œdipus,
driven by cruellest madness, slew his father, and Orestes smote
the breast of his own mother; let fire be counted evil, for it is
wont to burn houses and to consume cities; let water be
despised, for with it all the earth was flooded; in a word, let all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
elements be condemned, for they can be perversely used by
some perverse persons. And in this manner every good thing
can be changed to evil, and from it can proceed evil effects, if
placed in the hands of those who, as irrational beings, allow
themselves to be governed by the appetite, without moderation.
The ancient Carthage, rival of the Roman Empire, warlike
Numantia, Corinth made so fair, proud Thebes, and learned
Athens, and God's city Jerusalem, which were conquered and
laid desolate&mdash;are we to say therefore that love was the cause
of their destruction and ruin? Hence those who are accustomed
to speak ill of love, ought to speak ill of their own selves, for the
gifts of love, if they are used with moderation, are worthy of
perpetual praise; since in everything the mean was always
praised, or the extreme was blamed, for if we embrace virtue
beyond what suffices, the wise man will win the name of fool,
and the just of iniquitous. It was the opinion of the ancient
tragedian Chremes, that, as wine mixed with water is good, so
love, when moderate, is profitable, but it is the contrary when
immoderate; the generation of rational animals and brutes
would be naught if it did not proceed from love, and if it were
wanting on earth, the latter would be deserted and empty. The
ancients believed that love was the work of the gods, given for
the preservation and care of mankind. But, coming to what
you, Lenio, said of the sad and strange effects which love
produces in loving breasts, keeping them ever in ceaseless
tears, deep sighs, despairing fancies, without ever granting them
an hour of repose&mdash;let us see perchance what thing can be
desired in this life the attainment of which does not cost fatigue
and toil; and the more valuable a thing is, the more one must
suffer and does suffer for it. For desire presupposes a lack of the
desired object, and until it is gained there must needs be disturbance
in our mind. If then all human desires, without wholly
attaining what they desire, can be rewarded and contented with
a part of it being given them, and with all this it is compatible
to follow them, how strange it is that to attain what cannot
satisfy nor content the desire save with itself, one should suffer,
weep, fear and hope? He who desires lordships, commands,
honours, and riches, since he sees that he cannot reach the
highest rank he would wish, when he succeeds in settling in
some good position, is partly satisfied, for the hope which fails
him of not being able to ascend further, makes him stop where
he can, and where best he can. All this is the contrary in love,
for love has no other reward nor satisfaction save love itself, and
love itself is its own true reward; and for this reason it is
impossible for the lover to be content till he clearly knows that
he is truly loved, being assured of this by the loving tokens
which they know. And so they value highly a pleasing glance,
a pledge of any sort from their beloved, a trivial smile, or word,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
or jest they take for truth, as signs which are assuring them of
the reward they desire; and so, whenever they see tokens
contrary thereto, the lover is constrained to lament and grieve,
without having moderation in his sorrows, since he cannot have
it in his joys, when kind fortune and gentle love grant them to
him. And, as it is a task of such difficulty to bring another's
will to be one with mine, and to unite two souls in a knot and
bond so indissoluble that the thoughts of the two may be one
and all their deeds one, it is not strange that to achieve so lofty
a purpose one should suffer more than for aught else, since,
after it is achieved, it satisfies and gladdens beyond all things
that are desired in this life. Not always are the tears of lovers
shed with cause and reason, nor their sighs scattered, for if all
their tears and sighs were caused by seeing that their wish is
not responded to as is due, and with the reward that is sought
for, it would be necessary to consider first whither they raised
their fancy, and if they exalted it higher than their merit attains,
it is no wonder that, like some new Icarus, they fall consumed
into the river of miseries; and for these love will not incur the
blame, but their folly. With all this I do not deny, but affirm
that the desire of gaining what is loved, must needs cause
affliction, by reason of the want it presupposes, as I have
already said at other times; but I also say that to attain it
gives the greatest pleasure and happiness, like rest to the weary
and health to the sick. Together with this I acknowledge that
if lovers marked, as in the ancient custom, with white and black
stones their sad or happy days, without any doubt the unhappy
would be more; but I also recognise that the quality of one
white stone alone would excel the quantity of countless black
ones. And for a proof of this truth we see that lovers never
repent of being lovers, nay, rather, if anyone should promise them
to deliver them from love's disease, they would repel him as an
enemy; for even to suffer it is pleasant to them; and therefore,
oh lovers, let no fear prevent you from offering and dedicating
yourselves to love what should seem to you most difficult, nor
complain, nor repent, if you have raised things lowly to your
height, for love makes the little equal to the sublime, the lesser
to the greater; and with just resolve it tempers the various
dispositions of lovers, when with pure affection they receive its
grace in their hearts. Yield not to dangers, that the glory may
be so great as to take away the feeling of every sorrow; and, as
for the captains and emperors of old, as a reward for their toils
and fatigues, triumphs were prepared according to the greatness
of their victories, so for lovers are reserved a multitude of
pleasures and joys; and as with the former their glorious
reception made them forget all their past troubles and griefs, so
with the lover, when beloved by the beloved, his dreadful
dreams, his uncertain sleep, his waking nights, his restless days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
are turned to highest peace and happiness. Hence, Lenio, if
you condemn them for their sad effects, you should acquit them
for their pleasing and happy ones. And as for the interpretation
you gave of Cupid's form, I am going to say that you are almost
as wrong in it as in the other things you have said against love.
For to picture him a boy, blind, naked, with wings and arrows,
means nothing but that the lover must be a boy in not having a
double character, but one pure and simple; he must be blind
to every other object that might offer itself to him, save that
which he has already been able to see and yield to, naked
because he must have naught save what belongs to her he loves,
having wings of swiftness to be ready for all that may be
commanded him on her part, while he is depicted with arrows,
for the wound of the loving breast must needs be deep and
hidden, and that scarce may be disclosed save to the very cause
that is to cure it. That love should strike with two arrows
which operate in different ways, is to show us that in perfect
love there must be no mean between loving and not loving at
the same moment, but that the lover must love whole-heartedly
without any admixture of lukewarmness. Finally, Lenio, this
love it is which, if it destroyed the Trojans, made the Greeks
great; if it caused the works of Carthage to cease, it caused the
buildings of Rome to grow; if it took away the kingdom from
Tarquin, it brought back the republic to freedom. Though I
might here adduce many examples opposed to those I have
adduced of the <em>good</em> effects love causes, I do not wish to busy
myself with them, since they are so well known of themselves.
I only wish to ask you to be disposed to believe what I have
shown and to have patience to hear a song of mine which seems
as if it was composed in rivalry of yours; and if by it and by
what I have said to you, you should not be willing to be brought
over to love's side, and it should seem to you that you are not
satisfied of the truths I have declared concerning it, if the present
time permits it, or at any other you might choose and indicate, I
promise you to satisfy all the replies and arguments you might
wish to express in opposition to mine; and, for the present,
attend to me and listen:</p>

<p class="p01">The end of the reasoning and song of Thyrsis was the
beginning to confirm anew in all the reputation he had for
discretion, save in the loveless Lenio, to whom his reply did not
seem so good as to satisfy his understanding, and change him
from his first purpose. This was clearly seen, for he was already
giving signs of wishing to answer and reply to Thyrsis, had not
the praises Darinto and his companion, and all the shepherds
and shepherdesses present were giving the two, prevented it;
for Darinto's friend, taking his hand, said:</p>

<p>'I have just at this moment learnt how the power and wisdom
of love extends over every part of the earth; and that the place
where it is most refined and purified is in shepherds' breasts,
as has been shown to us by what we have heard from the loveless
Lenio and the discreet Thyrsis, whose reasonings and
arguments savour more of intellects nurtured amidst books and
lecture-rooms, than of those that have grown up amidst thatched
huts. But I would not be so astonished thereat, if I were of the
opinion of him who said that the knowledge of our souls was to
remember what they already knew, presupposing that they are
all born instructed. But when I see that I ought to follow the
other and better view of him who affirmed that our soul was as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
it were a blank canvas, which had nothing painted on it, I
cannot fail to wonder at seeing how it has been possible, in the
company of sheep, in the solitude of the fields, for one to be
able to acquire sciences, concerning which it is scarcely possible
to hold disputes in renowned universities; if, indeed, I do not
wish to be persuaded of what I said at first, that love extends
through all, and communicates itself to all, raising the fallen,
giving wisdom to the simple, and making perfect the wise.'</p>

<p>'If you knew, sir,' replied Elicio at this moment, 'how the
upbringing of the renowned Thyrsis has not been amidst trees
and forests, as you fancy, but in royal courts and well-known
schools, you would not wonder at what he has said, but at what
he has left unsaid; and although the loveless Lenio in his
humility has confessed that the rusticity of his life can promise
but slight pledges of intellect, nevertheless I assure you that he
spent the choicest years of his life, not in the pursuit of tending
goats on the hills, but on the banks of the clear Tormes in
laudable studies and discreet converse. So that if the colloquy
the two have held seems to you of more worth than one of shepherds,
consider them as they were, and not as they now are; all
the more so that you will find shepherds on these banks of ours,
who will not cause you less wonder if you hear them, than those
you have heard now. For on them are grazing their flocks the
famous and well-known Franio, Siralvo, Filardo, Silvano, Lisardo
and the two Matuntos, father and son, excelling beyond all
excellence, one on the lyre, the other in poetry; and, to crown
all, turn your eyes and know the well-known Damon, whom you
have before you, where your desire can rest if it wishes to know
the extreme of discretion and wisdom.'</p>

<p>The gentleman was about to reply to Elicio, when one of those
ladies who came with him said to the other:</p>

<p>'It seems to me, señora Nisida, that since the sun is now
setting it would be well for us to go, if we are to reach to-morrow
the spot where they say our father is.'</p>

<p>The lady had scarcely said this, when Darinto and his companion
looked at her, showing that it had grieved them that she
had called the other by her name. But when Elicio heard the
name of Nisida, the thought struck him whether it was that
Nisida of whom the hermit Silerio had related so many things,
and the same idea came to Thyrsis, Damon and Erastro. And
Elicio, to assure himself of what he suspected, said:</p>

<p>'A few days ago, señor Darinto, I and some of us who are
here heard the name of Nisida mentioned, as has been done by
that lady now, but accompanied by more tears and referred to
with more alarm.'</p>

<p>'Is there perchance,' replied Darinto, 'any shepherdess on
these banks of yours called Nisida?'</p>

<p>'No,' replied Elicio; 'but she whom I speak of was born on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
them, and was nurtured on the remote banks of the famous
Sebeto.'</p>

<p>'What is it you say, shepherd?' rejoined the other gentleman.</p>

<p>'What you hear,' replied Elicio, 'and what you will hear at
greater length, if you assure me of a suspicion I have.'</p>

<p>'Tell it me,' said the gentleman, 'for it might be that I shall
satisfy you therein.'</p>

<p>To this Elicio replied: 'Is your own name, sir, perchance
Timbrio?'</p>

<p>'I cannot deny that truth to you,' replied the other, 'for I am
called Timbrio, which name I had fain concealed till another
more fitting season; but the wish I have to know why you
suspected that I was so called, constrains me to conceal naught
from you of what you might wish to know of me.'</p>

<p>'Accordingly you will not deny to me either,' said Elicio,
'that this lady you have with you is called Nisida, and further,
so far as I can guess, the other is called Blanca, and is her
sister.'</p>

<p>'In all you have hit the mark,' replied Timbrio; 'but since I
have denied to you nothing of what you have asked me, do not
you deny me the reason that has moved you to ask it me.'</p>

<p>'It is as good, and will be as much to your taste,' replied
Elicio, 'as you will see before many hours.'</p>

<p>All those who did not know what the hermit Silerio had said
to Elicio, Thyrsis, Damon and Erastro, were confounded, hearing
what was passing between Timbrio and Elicio. But at this
moment Damon said, turning to Elicio:</p>

<p>'Do not keep back, oh Elicio, the good tidings you can give
to Timbrio.'</p>

<p>'And I, too,' said Erastro, 'shall not delay a moment in going
to give to the hapless Silerio those of the finding of Timbrio.'</p>

<p>'Holy Heavens! O, what is it I hear!' said Timbrio; 'and what
is it you say, shepherd? Is that Silerio you have named perchance
he who is my true friend, he who is the half of my life,
he whom I desire to see more than aught else that desire could
ask of me? Free me from this doubt at once, so may your
flocks increase and multiply, in such a manner that all the
neighbouring herdsmen may bear you envy.'</p>

<p>'Do not distress yourself so much, Timbrio,' said Damon,
'for the Silerio that Erastro speaks of is the same that you
speak of, and the one who desires more to know of your life
than to sustain and lengthen his own; for after you departed
from Naples, as he has told us, he has felt your absence so
much, that the pain of it, with that which other losses he related
to us caused him, has brought him to the pass that, in a small
hermitage, a little less than a league distant from here, he leads
the straitest life imaginable, with the determination of awaiting
death there, since he could not be satisfied by learning how your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
life had prospered. This we know for sure, Thyrsis, Elicio,
Erastro, and I; for he himself has told us of the friendship he
had with you, with all the story of the events that happened to
both, until fortune by such strange accidents parted you, to set
him apart to live in a solitude so strange, that it will cause you
wonder when you see him.'</p>

<p>'May I see him, and may straightway come the last end of my
days,' said Timbrio; 'and so I pray you, famous shepherds, by
that courtesy which dwells in your breasts, to satisfy this breast
of mine, by telling me where is that hermitage where Silerio
is living.'</p>

<p>'Where he is dying, you had better say,' said Erastro, 'but
henceforward he will live with the news of your coming; and
since you so much desire his pleasure and yours, arise and let us
go, for before the sun sets I will set you with Silerio; but it must
be on condition that on the way you tell us all that has happened
to you since you departed from Naples, for with all the rest up to
that point some of those present are acquainted.'</p>

<p>'Small payment you ask of me,' replied Timbrio, 'for so great
a thing as you offer me; for I do not say that I will tell you this,
but all that you might wish to learn of me and more.' And,
turning to the ladies who came with him, he said to them: 'Since
with so good a cause, dear lady Nisida, the motive we had not
to utter our own names has been destroyed, with the joy that
the good news they have given us demands, I ask you that we
should not delay, but that we should go forthwith to see Silerio,
to whom you and I owe our lives and the happiness we possess.'</p>

<p>'It is needless, señor Timbrio,' replied Nisida, 'for you to ask
me to do a thing I desire so much, and the doing of which suits
me so well; let us go, and may good luck attend us, for now
every moment that I delay in seeing him, will be to me an age.'</p>

<p>The same said the other lady, who was her sister Blanca, the
same that Silerio had spoken of, and the one who gave the
greatest signs of happiness. Darinto alone, at the news of Silerio,
assumed such an attitude that he did not move his lips, but with
a strange silence arose, and bade a servant of his bring him the
horse on which he had come there; without taking leave of any
one, he mounted it, and turning the reins went away from all
at a gallop. When Timbrio saw this, he mounted another horse
and with much haste followed Darinto until he overtook him;
and seizing hold of the horse's reins, he made him stand still,
and remained there talking with him a good while, at the end of
which Timbrio returned to where the shepherds were, and
Darinto pursued his journey, sending to excuse himself by
Timbrio for having departed without taking leave of them.
In the meantime Galatea, Rosaura, Teolinda, Leonarda, and
Florisa went up to the fair Nisida and Blanca; and the discreet
Nisida told them in a few words of the great friendship there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
was between Timbrio and Silerio, with a great part of the
events they had passed through. But with Timbrio's return all
wished to set themselves on the road for Silerio's hermitage, had
not at the same moment a fair young shepherdess, some fifteen
years of age, come to the spring, with her wallet on her shoulder
and her crook in her hand. And when she saw so pleasing a
company, she said to them with tears in her eyes:</p>

<p>'If perchance there is among you, gentlemen, one who has
any knowledge of the strange effects and accidents of love, and
whose breast tears and loving sights are wont to make tender,
let him who feels this hasten to see if it is possible to heal and
check the most loving tears and deep sighs that ever issued from
love-sick eyes and breasts; hasten then, shepherds, to do what I
ask you and you will see how when you observe what I show you
I prove my words true.'</p>

<p>And in saying this she turned her back, and all who were
there followed her. The shepherdess, seeing then that they
followed her, with hasty step entered in among some trees which
were on one side of the spring; and she had not gone far, when
turning to those who were coming after her, she said to them:</p>

<p>'You see there, sirs, the cause of my tears, for that shepherd
who appears there is a brother of mine, who for the sake of that
shepherdess before whom he is bent on his knees, without any
doubt will leave his life in the hands of her cruelty.'</p>

<p>All turned their eyes to the spot the shepherdess indicated,
and saw that at the foot of a green willow a shepherdess was
leaning, dressed like a huntress nymph, with a rich quiver hanging
at her side, and a curved bow in her hands, her beauteous
ruddy locks bound together with a green garland. The shepherd
was before her on his knees, with a rope cast round his throat
and an unsheathed knife in his right hand, and with his left he
had seized the shepherdess by a white scarf, which she wore
over her dress. The shepherdess showed a frown on her face,
and that she was displeased that the shepherd should detain her
there by force; but when she saw that they were looking at her,
with great earnestness she sought to free herself from the hand
of the hapless shepherd, who with abundance of tender tears
and loving words was begging her at least to give him opportunity
that he might be able to indicate to her the pain he
suffered for her; but the scornful and angry shepherdess went
away from him at the very moment all the shepherds came so
near that they heard the love-sick youth addressing the shepherdess
in such wise:</p>

<p>'Oh ungrateful and heedless Gelasia, with how just a title you
have won the name you have of cruel! Turn your eyes, hard-hearted
one, to behold him who, from beholding you, is in the
extremest grief imaginable. Why do you flee from him who
follows you? Why do you not welcome him who serves you?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
And why do you loathe him who adores you? You, who are
without reason my foe, hard as a lofty cliff, angry as a wounded
snake, deaf as a dumb forest, scornful as boorish, boorish as
fierce, fierce as a tiger, a tiger that feeds on my entrails! Will
it be possible for my tears not to soften you, for my sighs not to
rouse your pity, for my services not to move you? Yes, it will be
possible; since my brief and ill-starred lot wishes it, and yet it
will also be possible for you not to wish to tighten this noose I
have at my throat, nor to plunge this knife through this heart
that adores you. Turn, shepherdess, turn, and end the tragedy
of my wretched life, since with such ease you can make fast this
rope at my throat, or make bloody this knife in my breast.'</p>

<p>These and other like words the hapless shepherd uttered,
accompanied by sobs and tears so many that they moved to
compassion as many as heard him. But the cruel and loveless
shepherdess did not therefore cease to pursue her way, without
wishing even to turn her eyes to behold the shepherd, who, for
her sake, was in such a state; whereat all those who perceived
her angry disdain were not a little astonished, and it was
so great that even the loveless Lenio thought ill of the shepherdess's
cruelty. And so he with the old Arsindo went up to
ask her to be so good as to turn and hear the plaints of the love-sick
youth, even though she should have no intention of healing
them. But it was not possible to change her from her purpose,
rather she asked them not to count her discourteous in not
doing what they bade her; for her intention was to be the mortal
enemy of love and of all lovers, for many reasons which
moved her to it, and one of them was that from her childhood
she had dedicated herself to follow the pursuit of the chaste
Diana, adding to these so many reasons for not doing the
bidding of the shepherds that Arsindo held it for good to leave
her and return. The loveless Lenio did not do this, and when
he saw that the shepherdess was such an enemy of love as she
seemed, and that she agreed so completely with his loveless disposition,
he determined to know who she was, and to follow her
company for some days; and so he told her how he was the
greatest enemy love and lovers had, begging her that since they
agreed so much in their opinions, she would be so kind as not to
be wearied with his company which would not be hers longer than
she pleased. The shepherdess rejoiced to learn Lenio's intention,
and permitted him to come with her to her village, which was
two leagues from Lenio's. Therewith Lenio took leave of
Arsindo, begging him to excuse him to all his friends and to tell
them the reason that had moved him to go with the shepherdess,
and without waiting further, he and Gelasia went away
quickly and in a short while disappeared. When Arsindo
returned to tell what had passed with the shepherdess, he
found that all the shepherds had gone up to console the love-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>sick
shepherd, and that, as for the two of the three veiled
shepherdesses, one had fainted in the fair Galatea's lap, and the
other was in the embrace of the beauteous Rosaura, who likewise
had her face covered. She who was with Galatea was
Teolinda, and the other her sister Leonarda, whose hearts, as
soon as they saw the despairing shepherd whom they found
with Gelasia, were overwhelmed with a jealous and love-sick
faintness, for Leonarda believed the shepherd was her beloved
Galercio, and Teolinda counted it truth that he was her enamoured
Artidoro; and when the two saw him so subdued and
undone by the cruel Gelasia, they felt such grief in soul that all
senseless they fell fainting, one into Galatea's lap, the other into
Rosaura's arms. But a little while after Leonarda, coming to
herself, said to Rosaura:</p>

<p>'Alas, my lady, I verily believe that fortune has occupied all
the passes of my cure, since Galercio's will is so far from being
mine, as can be seen by the words that shepherd has spoken to
the loveless Gelasia; for I would have you know, lady, that
that is he who has stolen my freedom, nay he who is to end my
days.'</p>

<p>Rosaura was astonished at what Leonarda was saying; and
was more so when, Teolinda also having come to herself, she
and Galatea called her, and, all joining Florisa and Leonarda,
Teolinda said that that shepherd was her longed-for Artidoro;
but scarcely had she named him, when her sister replied to
her that she was deceived, for it was none but his brother
Galercio:</p>

<p>'Ah, traitorous Leonarda,' replied Teolinda, 'does it not
suffice you that you have once parted me from my bliss, without
wishing, now that I find it, to say that it is yours? Then undeceive
yourself, for in this I do not deem you a sister, but
an open foe.'</p>

<p>'Without doubt you deceive yourself, sister,' replied Leonarda,
'and I do not wonder, for into this same error all the people of
our village fell, believing that this shepherd was Artidoro, until
they clearly came to understand that it was none but his brother
Galercio, for they resemble each other as much as we do; and
indeed, if there can be greater likeness, they have a greater
likeness.'</p>

<p>'I will not believe it,' replied Teolinda, 'for, though we are so
much alike, these miracles are not so easily found in nature;
and so I would have you know that so long as experience does
not make me more certain of the truth than your words make
me, I do not think of ceasing to believe that that shepherd I see
there, is Artidoro; and if anything could make me doubt it, it
is that I do not think that from the disposition and constancy I
have known in Artidoro, it can be hoped or feared that he has
made a change so soon and forgets me.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>'Calm yourselves, shepherdesses,' then said Rosaura, 'for I
will free you soon from that doubt in which you are.'</p>

<p>And leaving them she went to where the shepherd was giving
to the shepherds account of Gelasia's strange disposition
and of the wrongs she did him. At his side the shepherd had
the fair little shepherdess who said he was her brother, whom
Rosaura called, and, withdrawing with her to one side, she
begged and prayed her to tell her what her brother was called,
and if she had any other like him. To this the shepherdess
replied that he was called Galercio, and that she had another
called Artidoro, who was so like him that they could scarcely be
distinguished save by some mark in their dress, or by the organ
of the voice, which differed somewhat. She asked her also what
Artidoro had been doing. The shepherdess answered her that
he was on some mountains some distance from there, grazing
part of Grisaldo's flock with another herd of goats of his own,
and that he had never been willing to enter the village, or to
hold converse with any one, since he had come from the banks
of Henares; and together with these she gave her such other
details that Rosaura was satisfied that the shepherd was not
Artidoro, but Galercio, as Leonarda had said and that shepherdess
said, whose name she learned was Maurisa. And
taking her with her to where Galatea and the other shepherdesses
were, she related again in the presence of Teolinda
and Leonarda all she knew of Artidoro and Galercio, whereat
Teolinda was soothed and Leonarda ill content, seeing how indisposed
Galercio's mind was to think of her affairs. In the
discourses the shepherdesses were holding, it chanced that
Leonarda called the veiled Rosaura by her name, and Maurisa,
hearing it, said:</p>

<p>'If I do not deceive myself, lady, my coming here and my
brother's has been on your account.'</p>

<p>'In what way?' said Rosaura.</p>

<p>'I will tell it you, if you give me leave to tell it you alone,'
replied the shepherdess.</p>

<p>'Willingly,' answered Rosaura, and the shepherdess going
aside with her, said to her:</p>

<p>'Without any doubt, fair lady, it is to you and to the
shepherdess Galatea that my brother and I come with a
message from our master Grisaldo.'</p>

<p>'That is the case,' replied Rosaura, and calling Galatea, both
listened to what Maurisa said from Grisaldo, which was to
inform them that he would come in two days with two friends
of his, to take her to his aunt's house, where they would in
secret celebrate their nuptials, and together with this she gave
to Galatea on behalf of Grisaldo some rich golden trinkets, by
way of thanks for the willingness she had shown to entertain
Rosaura. Rosaura and Galatea thanked Maurisa for the good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span>
news, and in reward for it the discreet Galatea wished to share
with her the present Grisaldo had sent her, but Maurisa would
in no way accept it. Then Galatea began again to ask information
about the strange likeness there was between Galercio and
Artidoro. All the time Galatea and Rosaura spent in talking
to Maurisa, Teolinda and Leonarda occupied in looking at
Galercio, for, Teolinda's eyes feasting on Galercio's face which
resembled Artidoro's so much, she could not withdraw them
from looking; and as those of the love-sick Leonarda knew on
what they were looking, it was also impossible for her to turn
them elsewhere. By this time the shepherds had consoled
Galercio, though, for the ill he suffered, he counted every
counsel and consolation vain and needless, all of which redounded
to Leonarda's hurt. Rosaura and Galatea, seeing that
the shepherds were coming towards them, bade Maurisa farewell,
telling her to tell Grisaldo that Rosaura would be in
Galatea's house. Maurisa took leave of them, and calling her
brother, told him in secret what had passed with Rosaura and
Galatea; and so with fair courtesy he took leave of them and of
the shepherds and with his sister returned to his village. But
the love-sick sisters Teolinda and Leonarda, who saw that when
Galercio went, the light of their eyes and the life of their life
went from them, both together approached Galatea and Rosaura
and asked them to give them leave to follow Galercio, Teolinda
giving as excuse that Galercio would tell her where Artidoro
was, and Leonarda that it might be that Galercio's will would
change, seeing the obligation in which he was to her. The
shepherdesses granted them leave on the condition that Galatea
had before begged of Teolinda that she should inform her of all
her good or ill fortune. Teolinda repeated her promise again,
and again taking her leave, followed the way Galercio and
Maurisa were pursuing. The same was done forthwith, though
in a different direction, by Timbrio, Thyrsis, Damon, Orompo,
Crisio, Marsilio, and Orfenio, who went their way to the hermitage
of Silerio with the fair sisters Nisida and Blanca, having
first all taken leave of the venerable Aurelio and of Galatea,
Rosaura and Florisa, and also of Elicio and Erastro, who did
not wish to fail to go back with Galatea, Aurelio offering that on
coming to his village, he would go straightway with Elicio and
Erastro to seek them at Silerio's hermitage, and would bring
something with which to make good the lack of means Silerio
would have to entertain such guests. With this understanding
they went away, some in one direction and some in another, and
missing the old Arsindo at the leave-taking, they saw that, without
taking leave of any one, he was going in the distance by the
same way Galercio and Maurisa and the veiled shepherdesses
were pursuing, whereat they wondered; and seeing that now
the sun was hastening his course to enter by the gates of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
west, they did not wish to delay there further, in order to come
to the village before the shades of night. Elicio and Erastro
then, seeing themselves before the lady of their thoughts, in
order to show somewhat that which they could not conceal, and
to lighten the fatigue of the way, and also to fulfil the bidding
of Florisa, who bade them sing something whilst they were
going to the village, to the sound of Florisa's pipe began, Elicio
to sing and Erastro to reply in this wise:</p>

<p class="p01">Those who were listening to Elicio and Erastro would have
held it a good thing that the way should be prolonged in order
to enjoy more the agreeable song of the love-sick shepherds;
but the closing-in of night and their coming to the village
caused them to cease from it, and Aurelio, Galatea, Rosaura,
and Florisa to betake themselves to their house. Elicio and
Erastro likewise went to theirs, with the intention of going forthwith
to where Thyrsis and Damon and the other shepherds
were, for so it was agreed between them and Galatea's father.
They were only waiting until the white moon should banish the
darkness of the night; and as soon as she showed her fair face,
they went to seek Aurelio, and all together made their way
towards the hermitage, where there happened to them what will
be seen in the following book.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BOOK V.</h2>

<p>So great was the desire the love-sick Timbrio and the two fair
sisters Nisida and Blanca felt to reach Silerio's hermitage that
the swiftness of their steps, though it was great, could not come
up to that of their will; and, knowing this, Thyrsis and Damon
would not press Timbrio to fulfil the word he had given to
relate to them on the way all that had happened during his
travels after he departed from Silerio. Nevertheless, carried
away by the desire they had to learn it, they were just going
to ask it of him, had there not at that moment smitten the ears
of all the voice of a shepherd, who was singing amongst some
green trees a little way off the road; from the somewhat untuneful
sound of his voice, and from what he was singing, he was at
once recognised by most of those who were coming along,
especially by his friend Damon, for it was the shepherd Lauso
who was repeating some verses to the sound of a small rebeck.
And because the shepherd was so well known, and all had
learned of the change which had taken place in his inclination,
they checked their steps of one accord, and stopped to listen to
what Lauso was singing, which was this:</p>

<p class="p01">The eager Timbrio neither could nor would wait for the
shepherd Lauso to proceed further with his song, for, begging
the shepherds to show him the way of the hermitage, if they
wished to remain, he gave signs of going on, and so all followed
him, and they passed so near to where the love-sick Lauso was,
that he could not fail to perceive it, and to come forth to meet
them, as he did; and all were delighted with his company,
especially Damon, his true friend, whom he accompanied all
the way there was from there to the hermitage, discoursing on
the different events that had happened to the two since they
ceased seeing each other, which was from the time the
valorous and renowned shepherd Astraliano had left the
Cisalpine pastures, to go and bring back those who had
rebelled from his famous brother and from the true religion.
And at last they came to bring back their discourse to treat of
Lauso's love, Damon asking him earnestly to tell him who the
shepherdess was who with such ease had won him from free
will; and when he could not learn this from Lauso he begged
him with all earnestness at least to tell him in what state he
was, whether of fear or of hope, whether ingratitude harassed
him, or whether jealousy tormented him. To all this Lauso
answered satisfactorily, telling him some things that had happened
to him with his shepherdess; and among other things he
told him, how, finding himself one day jealous and out of favour,
he had come to the pass of putting an end to himself, or of giving
some token that might redound to the hurt of his person and to
the credit and honour of his shepherdess, but all was remedied
when he had spoken to her, and she had assured him that the
suspicion he had was false. All this being confirmed by her
giving him a ring from her hand, which caused his understanding
to return to a better course, and that favour to be
celebrated by a sonnet, which was counted for good by some
who saw it. Damon then asked Lauso to repeat it; and so,
without being able to excuse himself, he had to repeat it, and it
was this:</p>

<p class="p01">Lauso repeated the sonnet, and Damon again asked him, if
he had written anything else to his shepherdess, to repeat it to
him, since he knew how pleasant his verses were for him to hear.
To this Lauso replied:</p>

<p>'This will be, Damon, because you have been my master
therein, and the desire you have to see what improvement you
have wrought in me makes you desire to hear them; but let
this be as it may, for nothing that I could do must be denied

jealous and ill at ease, I sent these verses to my shepherdess.'</p>

<p class="p01">Whilst Lauso was occupied in repeating these verses, and in
praising the unwonted beauty, discretion, grace, modesty, and
worth of his shepherdess, the tedium of the way was lightened
for him and Damon, and the time passed for them without
being perceived, until they came near to Silerio's hermitage,
which Timbrio, Nisida, and Blanca would not enter, so as not
to alarm him by their unexpected arrival. But fate ordained it
otherwise, for Thyrsis and Damon having approached to see
what Silerio was doing, found the hermitage open, and without
any one inside; and whilst they were filled with astonishment,
without knowing where Silerio could be at such an hour, there
came to their ears the sound of his harp, from which they understood
that he could not be far away. And going to look for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
him, guided by the sound of the harp, they saw by the bright
radiance of the moon, that he was seated on the trunk of an
olive, alone and without other company than that of his harp,
which he was playing so sweetly that to enjoy so gentle a
harmony, the shepherds would not approach to speak to him,
and the more so when they heard him beginning to sing with
exquisite voice these verses:</p>

<p class="p01">S<small>ILERIO.</small></p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swift fleeting hours of swiftly fleeting time,</span><br />

Be pleased to end me now, for 'tis full time.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">If now ye end me, 'twill be at a time</span><br />
When my misfortunes can no further go;<br />
See, if ye linger, they will lesser grow,<br />

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I do not ask that ye should come, with pleasure</span><br />
And sweetness filled, since ye no path will gain<br />

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hours, to all others blissful beyond measure,</span><br />
Grant me but the sweet hour of mortal pain,<br />
Even death's hour&mdash;this boon alone I lack.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">After the shepherds listened to what Silerio had sung without
his seeing them, they turned to meet the others who were coming
there, with the intent that Timbrio should do what you shall
now hear. This was, that, having told him how they had found
Silerio, and in the place where he was, Thyrsis asked him that,
without any of them letting themselves be recognised by him,
they should gradually go approaching towards him, whether he
saw them or not&mdash;for though the night was bright, no one would
be recognised on that account&mdash;and that he should likewise
make Nisida or himself sing something; and all this he did to
moderate the joy Silerio must needs feel from their arrival.
Timbrio was satisfied with this, and Nisida, being told it, came
to be of his opinion too; and so, when it seemed to Thyrsis
that they were now so near that they could be heard by Silerio,
he caused the fair Nisida to begin; and she, to the sound of the
jealous Orfenio's rebeck, began to sing in this wise:</p>

<p class="p01">N<small>ISIDA</small>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">What it costeth to attain</span><br />
Any joy of love so fair,<br />
Let our love and hope declare,<br />
And our patience make it plain;<br />

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which forever hath in mind</span><br />

Yet to find it, road or path<br />

</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">If the exquisite grace with which the fair Nisida was singing,
caused admiration in those who were with her, what would
it cause in the breast of Silerio, who, without missing anything,
noted and listened to all the details of her song?
And as he retained Nisida's voice so well in his soul, its accents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span>
scarce began to resound in his ears when he came to be perturbed,
and amazed and to be beside himself, enraptured by
what he heard. And though truly it seemed to him that it
was Nisida's voice, he had so lost the hope of seeing her, and
above all in such a place, that in no way could he make sure of
his suspicion. In this manner all came to where he was; and
Thyrsis, greeting him, said to him:</p>

<p>'You left us, friend Silerio, so attracted by your disposition
and converse, that Damon and I, drawn by experience of them,
and all this company by their fame, leaving the way we were
taking, have come to seek you in your hermitage, and when we
did not find you there, as we did not, our desire would have
remained unfulfilled, had not the sound of your harp and of your
admirable song guided us here.'</p>

<p>'Far better had it been, sirs,' replied Silerio, 'that you had
not found me, since in me you will find naught save occasions to
move you to sadness, for the sadness I endure in my soul time
takes care each day to renew, not only with the memory of the
past happiness, but with the shadows of the present, which at
last will be so indeed, since from my fortune naught else can be
hoped for, save feigned happiness and certain fear.'</p>

<p>Silerio's words caused pity in all who knew him, especially in
Timbrio, Nisida, and Blanca, who loved him so much, and they
would straightway have let themselves be known by him had it
not been that it would be deviating from what Thyrsis had
bidden them. He made them all sit down on the green grass,
and in such a way that the rays of the bright moon should strike
the faces of Nisida and Blanca from behind, in order that Silerio
might not recognise them. Being then in this fashion, and after
Damon had said some words of consolation to Silerio, in order
that the time should not be spent wholly in discoursing on
things of sadness, and to make a beginning, so that Silerio's
sadness might end, he begged him to play his harp, to the sound
of which Damon himself sang this sonnet:</p>

<div class="p01">D<small>AMON.</small></div>
<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">If the wild fury of the angry main</span><br />
Should long time in its ruthlessness endure,<br />
Whoso should to the storm his vessel, poor<br />
And frail, entrust, could little comfort gain.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bliss doth not always in one state remain,</span><br />
Nor woe, but each of them doth fly away,<br />
For if bliss were to flee, and woe to stay,<br />
Ere this the world had been confusion plain.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Night follows after day, heat after cold,</span><br />
After the fruit the flower, and thus we find<br />
Opposites reconciling everywhere.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meek slavery is changed to lordship bold,</span><br />
Pain into pleasure, glory into wind,<br />
'For nature is by such transformings fair.'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p class="p01">Damon ceased singing, and straightway beckoned to Timbrio
to sing likewise. He, to the sound of Silerio's harp, began a
sonnet which he had composed in the time of his love's fervour,
which was as well known to Silerio as to Timbrio himself.</p>



<p class="p01">T<small>IMBRIO.</small></p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">My hope is builded on so sure a base</span><br />
That, though the fiercer blow the ruthless wind,<br />
It cannot shake the bonds that firmly bind,<br />
Such faith, such strength, such fortune it displays.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">Timbrio could not end the sonnet he had begun, for Silerio's
hearing of his voice and recognition of him took place together,
and, unable to do aught else, he arose from where he was
seated, and went to embrace Timbrio's neck with tokens of
such strange content and surprise, that without speaking a word
he became faint and was for a while without consciousness,
with such grief on the part of those present, who feared some
mishap, that they already condemned as evil Thyrsis's artifice;
but she who showed the most extremes of grief was the fair
Blanca, as the one who tenderly loved him. Straightway
Nisida and her sister came up to give remedy to the swoon of
Silerio, who after a little while came to himself, saying:</p>

<p>'Oh, mighty Heaven! is it possible that he I have before me
is my true friend Timbrio? Is it Timbrio I hear, is it Timbrio
I see? Yes it is, if my fortune does not mock me, and my eyes
deceive me not.'</p>

<p>'Neither does your fortune mock you, nor do your eyes
deceive you, my sweet friend,' replied Timbrio, 'for I am he who
without you was not, and he who would never have been, had
Heaven not permitted him to find you. Let your tears now
cease, friend Silerio, if for me you have shed them, since now
you have me here, for I will check mine, since I have you before
me, calling myself the happiest of all that live in the world,
since my misfortunes and adversities have been so discounted
that my soul enjoys the possession of Nisida, and my eyes
your presence.'</p>

<p>By these words of Timbrio's Silerio knew that she who had
sung, and she who was there, was Nisida; but he was more sure
of it, when she herself said to him:</p>

<p>'What is this, Silerio mine? What solitude and what garb is
this, which gives such tokens of your discontent? What false
suspicions or what deceptions have brought you to such an
extreme, in order that Timbrio and I might endure the extreme
of grief all our life, being absent from you who gave it to us?'</p>

<p>'They were deceptions, fair Nisida,' replied Silerio, 'but
because they have brought such ways of undeceiving they will
be celebrated by my memory so long as it shall last in me.'</p>

<p>For the most of this time Blanca had been holding one of
Silerio's hands, gazing intently on his face, shedding some tears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>
which gave manifest proof of the joy and pity of her heart. It
would be long to relate the words of love and content that
passed between Silerio, Timbrio, Nisida, and Blanca, which
were so tender and of such a kind, that all the shepherds who
heard them had their eyes bathed in tears of joy. Straightway
Silerio related briefly the cause that had moved him to withdraw
to that hermitage, with the thought of ending therein his life,
since of theirs he had not been able to learn any news; and all
that he said was the means of kindling yet more in Timbrio's
breast the love and friendship he had for Silerio, and in Blanca's
friendship for his misery. And so when Silerio finished relating
what had happened to him after he left Naples, he asked
Timbrio to do the same, for he desired it extremely; saying that
he should not be afraid of the shepherds who were present, for
all or most of them already knew his great friendship and part
of his adventures. Timbrio was delighted to do what Silerio
asked, and the shepherds, who likewise desired it, were more
delighted; for seeing that Thyrsis had told it to them, all knew
already the love-affair of Timbrio and Nisida, and all that which
Thyrsis himself had heard from Silerio. All then being seated,
as I have already said, on the green grass, they were awaiting
with wondrous attention what Timbrio would say, and he said:</p>

<p>'After fortune was so favourable to me and so adverse, that it
allowed me to conquer my enemy and conquered me by the
consternation of the false news of Nisida's death, with such
sorrow as can be imagined, at that very moment I left for
Naples, and Nisida's unlucky fate being confirmed there, so as
not to see her father's house, where I had seen her, and in order
that the streets, windows, and other spots where I was wont to
see her, might not continually renew in me the memory of my
past happiness, without knowing what way to take, without my
will following any course, I went from the city, and in two days
came to strong Gaeta, where I found a ship which was just on
the point of unfurling its sails to the wind to leave for Spain; I
embarked on it, only to flee from the hateful land where I was
leaving my heaven. But scarcely had the busy sailors weighed
anchor and spread their sails, and put out some distance to
sea, when there arose a sudden and unthought-of tempest, and a
squall of wind smote the ship's sails with such fury that it broke the
foremast and split the mizzen sail from top to bottom. Straightway
the ready sailors came to the rescue and with the greatest
difficulty furled all the sails, for the tempest was increasing, and
the sea was beginning to rise, and the sky was giving signs of a
long and fearful storm. It was not possible to return to port,
for the wind which blew was the mistral, and with such great
violence that it was necessary to set the foresail on the mainmast,
and to ease her, as they say, by the stern, letting her drive
where the wind might will. And so the ship, driven by its fury,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
began to run with such speed over the stormy sea, that in the two
days the mistral lasted, we ran by all the islands in that course,
without being able to take shelter in any, passing always in
sight of them, without Stromboli sheltering us, or Lipari receiving
us, or Cimbalo, Lampadosa, or Pantanalea serving for our
aid; and we passed so near to Barbary that the recently
destroyed walls of the Goleta were revealed and the ancient ruins
of Carthage showed themselves. Not small was the alarm of
those on board the ship, who feared that if the wind became
somewhat stronger, they must needs be driven on a hostile
coast; but when they were most in fear of this, fate, which was
keeping a better one in store for us, or Heaven which heard the
vows and promises made there, ordained that the mistral should
be changed into a south wind which was so strong&mdash;and which
touched on the quarter of the sirocco,&mdash;that in another two days
it brought us back to the very port of Gaeta from which we had
started, with such relief to all that some set out to fulfil the
pilgrimages and promises they had made in the past danger.
The ship remained there, being refitted with some things she
required, for another four days, at the end of which she resumed
her voyage in a calmer sea and with a favourable wind, keeping
in sight the fair coast of Genoa, full of gay gardens, white houses,
and gleaming pinnacles, which, being struck by the sun's rays,
flash with such burning rays that they can scarcely be looked
at. All these things which were being seen from the ship,
might have caused content, as indeed they did to all those who
were on board the ship, except to me, for to me they were the cause
of greater sorrow. The only relief I had was to occupy myself
in lamenting my woes, singing them, or, let me say rather,
bewailing them to the sound of a lute belonging to one of the
sailors; and one night I remember&mdash;and indeed it is well that I
should remember, since then my day began to dawn,&mdash;that, the sea
being calm, the winds still, the sails fixed to the mast, and the
sailors without any care lying stretched in different parts of the
ship, and the helmsman almost asleep by reason of the fair
weather there was, and that which the sky promised, in the
midst of this silence and in the midst of my fancies, as my griefs
did not suffer me to yield my eyes to sleep, seated on the
poop, I took the lute, and began to sing some verses, which
I must now repeat, in order that it may be noted from what
extreme of sadness, and how without thinking it, fate led me
to the greatest extreme of joy imaginable; this, if I remember
right, was what I sang:</p>

<p class="p01">T<small>IMBRIO.</small></p>

<p class="p01">'I remember that I came to these last verses I have repeated,
when, without being able to proceed further, interrupted by
countless sighs and sobs which I sent forth from my hapless
breast, afflicted by the memory of my misfortunes, from merely
feeling them I came to lose my senses by such a paroxysm that
for a good while it held me unconscious; but after the bitter
attack had passed, I opened my wearied eyes and found my
head lying in the lap of a woman, dressed in pilgrim's attire,
and at my side was another, decked in the same garb, who was
holding my hands whilst both wept tenderly. When I saw myself
in that position, I was amazed and confused, and was
doubting whether it was a vision I saw, for never had I seen
such women in the ship since I had gone on board. But the
fair Nisida here&mdash;for she was the pilgrim who was there&mdash;drew
me from this confusion, saying to me: "Ah, Timbrio, my true
lord and friend, what false fancies or what luckless accidents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span>
have caused you to be placed where you now are, and my sister
and me to take such little account of what we owed to our
honour, and without heeding any difficulty to have wished
to leave our beloved parents and our wonted garb, with the
intention of looking for you and of undeceiving you about my
so doubtful death which might have caused yours in reality?"
When I heard such words, I became quite convinced that I was
dreaming, and that it was some vision I had before my eyes, and
that my ceaseless thoughts that did not depart from Nisida
were the cause that represented her there to my eyes alive. A
thousand questions I asked them and in all they completely
satisfied me, before I could calm my understanding and
assure myself that they were Nisida and Blanca. But when I
came to learn the truth, the joy I felt was such that it, too, well-nigh
brought me to the pass of losing my life as the past grief
had done. Then I learned from Nisida how your mistake and
neglect, oh Silerio, in making the signal of the kerchief, was the
cause why she, believing that some ill had befallen me, fell into
such a swoon and faint, that all believed her to be dead, as I
thought, and you, Silerio, believed. She also told me how, after
coming to herself, she learned the truth of my victory together
with my sudden and hasty departure, and your absence, the
news of which brought her to the verge of making true that of
her death; but as it did not bring her to the last extreme, it
caused her and her sister, by the artifice of a nurse of theirs
who came with them, to dress themselves in the attire of pilgrims,
and in disguise to go away from their parents one night
when they were approaching Gaeta on the return they were
making to Naples. And it was at the time when the ship on
which I had embarked, having been repaired after the storm
which had passed, was on the point of departing; and telling
the captain they wished to cross over to Spain to go to Santiago
of Galicia, they agreed with him and embarked with the intention
of coming to seek me at Xeres, where they thought to find
me or to learn some news of me; and all the time they had
been in the ship, which would be four days, they had not left a
cabin which the captain had given them in the stern, until,
hearing me sing the verses I have repeated to you, and recognising
me by the voice, and by what I said in them, they came
out at the moment I have told you, when, celebrating with
joyous tears the happiness of having found one another,
we were looking at one another, without knowing with
what words to increase our new and unexpected joy, which
would have grown the greater, and would have reached
the point and pass it has now reached, if we had then
known any news of you, friend Silerio. But, as there is no
pleasure which comes so perfect as wholly to satisfy the heart,
in that we then felt, there was wanting to us, not only your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span>
presence, but even news of it. The brightness of the night, the
cool and pleasing wind (which favouring and gentle at that
moment began to strike the sails), the calm sea and the cloudless
sky, it seems, all together, and each by itself, helped to
celebrate the joy of our hearts. But fickle fortune, from whose
disposition one can make sure of no stability, envious of our
happiness, chose to disturb it by the greatest mishap that could
have been imagined, had not time and favouring circumstances
turned it to a better issue. It happened then that at the time
the wind began to freshen, the busy sailors hoisted all the sails
higher and assured themselves of a safe and prosperous voyage
to the general joy of all. One of them, who was seated on one
side of the bow, discovered by the brightness of the moon's low
rays, that four rowing vessels with long-drawn-out stroke were
approaching the ship with great speed and haste, and at the
moment he knew that they were an enemy's, and with loud cries
began to shout: "To arms, to arms, for Turkish vessels are in
sight!" This cry and sudden alarm caused such panic in all
the crew of the ship, that, without being able to take thought for
the approaching danger, they looked at one another; but its
captain (who had sometimes seen himself in similar circumstances),
coming to the bow, sought to learn how large the
vessels were and how many, and he discovered two more than
the sailor, and recognised that they were galliots with slave
crews, whereat he must needs have felt no small fear. But,
dissembling as best he could, he straightway ordered the guns
to be prepared and the sails to be trimmed as much as
possible to meet the opposing vessels so as to see if he
could go between them and let the guns play on every
side. Straightway all rushed to arms, and, dispersed at
their posts, as well as could be, awaited the coming of the
enemy. Who will be able to express to you, sirs, the pain
I felt at this moment, seeing my happiness disturbed with such
quickness, and myself so near the chance of losing it, and the
more when I saw Nisida and Blanca looking at each other
without speaking a word, confused by the uproar and shouting
there was in the ship, and seeing myself asking them to shut
themselves up in their cabin and pray to God to deliver us
from the enemy's hands? This was a situation which makes the
imagination faint when the memory recalls it; their open tears,
and the violence I did myself so as not to show mine, held me
in such a way that I had almost forgotten what I ought to do,
who I was, and what the danger required. But at last I made
them withdraw almost fainting to their cabin, and shutting them
in from outside, hastened to see what the captain was ordering.
He with prudent care was providing everything necessary for
the emergency, and entrusting to Darinto, the gentleman who
left us to-day, the guard of the forecastle, and handing over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
to me the poop, he with some sailors and passengers
hurried through all the waist of the ship from one part to
another. The enemy did not delay much in approaching, and
the wind delayed rather less in growing calm, which was the
complete cause of our ruin. The enemy did not dare to board,
for, seeing that the weather was growing calm, it seemed to them
better to wait for the day in order to attack us. They did so,
and, when the day came, though we had already counted them,
we saw finally that it was fifteen big vessels that had surrounded
us, and then the fear of being lost was at once confirmed in our
breasts. Nevertheless, the valiant captain, not losing heart&mdash;nor
did any of those who were with him,&mdash;waited to see what
the enemy would do. They, as soon as morning came, lowered
a boat from their flagship, and sent by a renegade to tell our
captain to surrender, since he saw he could not defend himself
against so many vessels, and the more so that they were all the
best in Algiers, threatening him on behalf of Arnaut Mami, his
general, that if the ship discharged a single piece, he would
hang him from a yard-arm when he caught him, and the renegade,
adding to these other threats, urged him to surrender. But the
captain, not wishing to do so, told the renegade in reply to sheer
off from the ship or he would send him to the bottom with the
guns. Arnaut heard this reply, and straightway priming the
guns of his ship everywhere, began to play them from a distance
with such speed, fury, and din, that it was a marvel. Our ship
began to do the same with such good fortune that she sent to
the bottom one of the vessels that were attacking her at the
stern, for she hit her with a ball close to the harpings, in such a
manner that the sea swallowed her without receiving any succour.
The Turks, seeing this, hurried on the fight, and in four hours
attacked us four times and as many times retired with great loss
on their part, and no small loss on ours. But, not to weary you
by relating to you in detail the things that happened in this fight,
I will only say that after we had fought sixteen hours, and after
our captain and nearly all the crew of the ship had perished, at
the end of nine assaults they made upon us, at the last they
furiously boarded the ship. Though I should wish, yet I cannot
exaggerate the grief that came to my soul when I saw that my
beloved darlings whom now I have before me, must needs then
be handed over to, and come into the power of those cruel
butchers; and so, carried away by the wrath this fear and thought
caused in me, I rushed with unarmed breast through the midst
of the barbarous swords, desirous of dying from the cruelty of
their edge, rather than to see with my eyes what I expected.
But things came to pass differently from what I had feared,
for, three stalwart Turks grappling with me, and I struggling
with them, we all fell up confusedly against the door of
the cabin where Nisida and Blanca were, and with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span>
force of the blow the door was broken open, displaying
the treasure that was there enclosed. The enemy lusting
after it, one of them seized Nisida and the other Blanca;
and I, seeing myself free from the two made the other who
held me leave his life at my feet, and I thought to do the
same with the two, had they not, warned of the danger, given
up their hold of the two ladies and stretched me on the floor with
two great wounds. Nisida, seeing this, threw herself upon my
wounded body and with lamentable cries begged the two Turks
to finish her. At this moment, drawn by the cries and laments
of Nisida and Blanca, Arnaut, the general of the vessels, hurried
up to the cabin, and, learning from the soldiers what was going
on, had Nisida and Blanca carried to his galley, and at Nisida's
prayer also gave orders for them to carry me thither, since I was
not yet dead. In this manner, without my being conscious, they
carried me to the enemy's flagship, where I was straightway
tended with some diligence, for Nisida had told the captain that
I was a man of rank and of great ransom, with the intention that,
tempted by the bait of covetousness and of the money they
might get from me, they should look after my health with somewhat
more care. It happened then, that, as my wounds were
being tended, I returned to consciousness with the pain of them,
and turning my eyes in every direction, I knew I was in the
power of my enemies, and in the enemy's vessel; but nothing
touched my soul so much as to see at the stern of the galley
Nisida and Blanca sitting at the feet of the dog of a general, shedding
from their eyes countless tears, the tokens of the inward
grief they were suffering. Neither the fear of the shameful death
I was awaiting when you, good friend Silerio, in Catalonia freed
me from it; neither the false tidings of Nisida's death, believed
by me as true; neither the pain of my deadly wounds, nor any
other affliction I might imagine, caused me, nor will cause more
anguish than that which came to me at seeing Nisida and
Blanca in the power of that barbarous unbeliever, where their
honour was placed in such imminent and manifest peril. The
pain of this anguish worked so much upon my soul that I once
again lost my senses, and took away the hope of my health and
life from the surgeon who was tending me, in such a manner that
believing I was dead, he stopped in the midst of his tending of
me, assuring all that I had already passed from this life. When
this news was heard by the two hapless sisters, let them say what
they felt, if they make so bold, for I can only say that I afterwards
learned that the two, rising from where they were, tearing
their ruddy locks, and scratching their fair faces, without anyone
being able to hold them back, came to where I lay in a faint,
and there began to make so piteous a lament, that they moved
to compassion the very breasts of the cruel barbarians. By
reason of Nisida's tears which were falling on my face, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
through the wounds already cold and swollen which caused me
great pain, I returned again to consciousness, to be conscious of
my new misfortune. I will pass in silence now the piteous and
loving words that in that hapless moment passed between Nisida
and myself, so as not to sadden so much the joyous moment in
which we now find ourselves, nor do I wish to relate in detail the
dire straits she told me she had passed through with the captain.
He, overcome by her beauty, made her a thousand promises, a
thousand gifts, a thousand threats, that she might come to
submit to his lawless will; but showing herself towards him as
scornful as modest, and as modest as scornful, she was able all
that day and the following night to defend herself from the hateful
importunities of the corsair. But as Nisida's continued
presence went on increasing in him every moment his lustful
desire, without any doubt it might have been feared, as I did
fear, that by his abandoning his prayers and using violence,
Nisida might lose her honour or life, the latter being the likelier
to be expected from her virtue. But fortune, being now weary
of having placed us in the lowest stage of misery, chose to show
us that what is published abroad of her instability is true, by a
means which brought us to the pass of praying Heaven to keep
us in that hapless lot, instead of losing our lives on the swollen
billows of the angry sea: which after two days that we were
captives, and at the time we were taking the direct course to
Barbary, moved by a furious sirocco, began to rise mountains
high, and to lash the pirate fleet with such fury, that the wearied
oarsmen, without being able to avail themselves of the oars,
bridled them and had recourse to the wonted remedy of the
foresail on the mast, and of letting themselves run wherever the
wind and sea listed. And the tempest increased in such a
manner that in less than half an hour it scattered and dispersed
the vessels in different directions, without any of them being
able to give heed to following their captain, but rather in a little
while, all being separated as I have said, our vessel came to be
left alone, and to be the one that danger threatened most; for
she began to make so much water through her seams, that however
much they bailed her in all the cabins at the stern, bow,
and mizzen, the water in the bilge all the time reached the
knee. And to all this misfortune was added the approach of
night, which in such cases, more than in any others, increases
dread fear; and it came with such darkness and renewed tempestuousness,
that we all wholly despaired of help. Seek not
to learn more, sirs, save that the very Turks begged the
Christians, who were captives at the oar, to invoke and call on
their saints and their Christ, to deliver them from such misfortune,
and the prayers of the wretched Christians who were
there were not so much in vain that high Heaven moved by
them let the wind grow calm, nay rather it increased it with such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span>
force and fury, that at break of day, which could only be told by
the hours of the sand-glass by which they are measured, the
ill-steered vessel found herself off the coast of Catalonia, so near
land, and so unable to get away from it, that it was necessary to
hoist the sail a little higher, in order that she might drive with
more force upon a wide beach which offered itself to us in front;
for the love of life made the slavery the Turks expected appear
sweet to them. Scarcely had the galley driven ashore, when
straightway there hurried down to the beach a number of people
armed, whose dress and speech showed them to be Catalans,
and the coast to be Catalonia, and even the very spot where at
the risk of yours, friend Silerio, you saved my life. Who could
exaggerate now the joy of the Christians, who saw their necks
free and relieved from the unbearable and heavy yoke of bitter
captivity; and the prayers and entreaties the Turks, free a little
while before, made to their own slaves, begging them to see
that they were not ill-treated by the angry Christians, who were
already awaiting them on the beach, with the desire of avenging
the wrong these very Turks had done them, in sacking their
town, as you, Silerio, know? And the fear they had did not
turn out vain for them, for the people of the place, entering the
galley which lay stranded on the sand, wrought such cruel havoc
on the corsairs that very few were left with life; and had it not
been that the greedy desire of sacking the galley blinded them,
all the Turks had been killed in this first onslaught. Finally
the Turks who remained, and we captive Christians who came
there, were all plundered; and if the clothes I wore had not
been stained with blood, I believe they would not have left me
even them. Darinto who was also there, helped straightway
to look after Nisida and Blanca, and to see that I might be
taken ashore to be tended there. When I came out and recognised
the place where I was, and considered the danger in
which I had seen myself there, it did not fail to give me some
anxiety, caused by the fear of being known and punished for
what I ought not to be; and so I begged Darinto to arrange for
us to go to Barcelona without making any delay, telling him the
cause that moved me to it. But it was not possible, for my
wounds distressed me in such a way that they forced me to be
there for some days, as I was, without being visited save by a
surgeon. In the meantime Darinto went to Barcelona, whence he
returned, providing himself with what we needed; and, as he found
me better and stronger, we straightway took the road for the city
of Toledo, to learn of Nisida's kinsmen if they knew of her parents,
to whom we have already written all the late events of our lives,
asking forgiveness for our past errors. And all the happiness
and grief from these good and evil events has been increased
and diminished by your absence, Silerio. But since Heaven has
now, with such great blessings, given a remedy to our calamities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span>
there remains naught else save that you, friend Silerio, should
render it fitting thanks therefor, and banish the past sadness by
reason of the present joy, and endeavour to give it to one who
for many days has for your sake lived without it, as you shall
learn when we are more alone, and I acquaint you therewith.
There remain some other things for me to tell, which have
happened to me in the course of this my journey; but I must
leave them for the nonce, so as not, by reason of their tediousness,
to displease these shepherds, who have been the instrument
of all my delight and pleasure. This, then, friend Silerio
and shepherd friends, is the issue of my life. Mark if, from the
life I have gone through and from that I go through now, I can
call myself the most ill-starred and the happiest man of those
that are living to-day.'</p>

<p>With these last words the joyful Timbrio ended his tale, and
all those that were present rejoiced at the happy issue his toils
had had, Silerio's content passing beyond all that can be said.
He, turning anew to embrace Timbrio, and constrained by the
desire to learn who the person was that for his sake lived without
content, begged leave of the shepherds, and went apart with
Timbrio on one side, where he learned from him that the fair
Blanca, Nisida's sister, was the one who loved him more than
herself, from the very day and moment she learned who he was
and the worth of his character, and that, so as not to go
against what she owed to her honour, she had never wished to
reveal this thought except to her sister, by whose agency she
hoped to have honoured him in the fulfilment of her desires.
Timbrio likewise told him how the gentleman Darinto, who
came with him and of whom he had made mention in his late
discourse, knowing who Blanca was, and carried away by her
beauty, had fallen in love with her so earnestly that he asked
her from her sister Nisida as his wife, and she undeceived him
saying that Blanca would by no means consent; and that Darinto
being angry thereat, believing that they rejected him for his
little worth, Nisida, in order to free him from this suspicion, had
to tell him how Blanca had her thoughts busied with Silerio;
but that Darinto had not turned faint-hearted on this account,
nor abandoned his purpose&mdash;'for as he knew that no news was
known of you, Silerio, he fancied that the services he thought to
render to Blanca, and the lapse of time, would make her desist
from her first intention. And with this motive he would never
leave us, until hearing yesterday from the shepherds sure tidings
of your life, knowing the happiness that Blanca had felt thereat,
and considering it to be impossible that Darinto could gain what
he desired when Silerio appeared, he went away from all, without
taking leave of anyone, with tokens of the greatest grief.'</p>

<p>Together with this Timbrio counselled his friend to be content
that Blanca was to have him, choosing her and accepting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span>
her as wife, since he already knew her and was not ignorant
of her worth and modesty; and he dwelt on the joy and pleasure
they both would have seeing themselves wedded to two such
sisters. Silerio asked him in reply to give him time to think
about this action, though he knew that in the end it was impossible
not to do what he bade him. At this moment the white
dawn was already beginning to give tokens of its new approach,
and the stars were gradually hiding their brightness; and at
this point there came to the ears of all the voice of the love-sick
Lauso, who, as his friend Damon had known that they must
needs spend that night in Silerio's hermitage, wished to be with
him, and with the other shepherds. And as it was all his pleasure
and pastime to sing to the sound of his rebeck the prosperous or
adverse issue of his love, carried away by his mood, and invited
by the solitude of the road and by the delicious harmony of the
birds, who were already beginning to greet the coming day with
their sweet concerted song, he came singing in a low voice
verses such as these:</p>

<p class="p01">The love-sick Lauso ended his song and his journey at the
same moment, and he was lovingly received by all who were
with Silerio, increasing by his presence the joy all had by
reason of the fair issue Silerio's troubles had had; and, as
Damon was telling them to him, there appeared close to the
hermitage the venerable Aurelio, who, with some of his shepherds,
was bringing some dainties wherewith to regale and
satisfy those who were there, as he had promised the day before
he left them. Thyrsis and Damon were astonished to see him
come without Elicio and Erastro, and they were more so when
they came to know the cause why they had stayed behind.
Aurelio approached, and his approach would have increased the
more the happiness of all, if he had not said, directing his
words to Timbrio:</p>

<p>'If you prize yourself, as it is right you should prize yourself,
valiant Timbrio, as being a true friend of him who is yours, now
is the time to show it, by hurrying to tend Darinto, who, no
great distance from here, is so sad and afflicted and so far from
accepting any consolation in the grief he suffers that some
words of consolation I gave him did not suffice for him to take
them as such. Elicio, Erastro, and I found him, some two
hours ago in the midst of yonder mountain which reveals itself
on this our right hand, his horse tied by the reins to a pine tree,
and himself stretched on the ground face downwards, uttering
tender and mournful sighs, and from time to time he spoke
some words which were directed to curse his fortune. And at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
the piteous sound of them we approached him, and by the
moon's rays, though with difficulty, he was recognised by us and
pressed to tell us the cause of his woe. He told it to us, and
thereby we learned the little remedy he had. Nevertheless
Elicio and Erastro have remained with him, and I have come
to give you the news of the plight in which his thoughts hold
him; and since they are so manifest to you, seek to remedy
them with deeds, or hasten to console them with words.'</p>

<p>'Words, good Aurelio,' replied Timbrio, 'will be all I shall
spend thereon, if indeed he is not willing to avail himself of the
occasion to undeceive himself and to dispose his desires so that
time and absence may work in him their wonted effects; but,
that he may not think that I do not respond to what I owe to
his friendship, tell me, Aurelio, where you left him, for I wish to
go at once to see him.'</p>

<p>'I will go with you,' replied Aurelio, and straightway at the
moment all the shepherds arose to accompany Timbrio and to
learn the cause of Darinto's woe, leaving Silerio with Nisida
and Blanca to the happiness of the three, which was so great
that they did not succeed in uttering a word. On the way from
there to where Aurelio had left Darinto, Timbrio told those
who went with him the cause of Darinto's sorrow, and the little
remedy that might be hoped for it, since the fair Blanca, for
whom he was sorrowing, had her thoughts set on her good
friend Silerio, saying to them likewise that he must needs strive
with all his skill and powers that Silerio might grant what
Blanca desired, and begging them all to help and favour his
purpose, for, on leaving Darinto, he wished them all to ask
Silerio to consent to receive Blanca as his lawful wife. The
shepherds offered to do what he bade them; and during these
discourses they came to where Aurelio believed Elicio, Darinto,
and Erastro would be; but they did not find anyone, though they
skirted and covered a great part of a small wood which was there,
whereat they felt no little sorrow. But, while in it, they heard
a sigh so mournful that it set them in confusion and in the desire
to learn who had uttered it; but they were quickly drawn from
this doubt by another which they heard no less sad than the
former, and all hurrying to the spot whence the sigh came, saw
not far from them at the foot of a tall walnut tree two shepherds,
one seated on the green grass, and the other stretched on the
ground, his head placed on the other's knees. The one seated
had his head bent down, shedding tears and gazing intently on
him whom he had on his knees, and, for this reason, as also
because the other had lost his colour and was of pallid countenance,
they were not able at once to know who he was; but
when they came nearer, they knew at once that the shepherds
were Elicio and Erastro, Elicio the pallid one, and Erastro the
one that wept. The sad appearance of the two hapless shep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>herds
caused great wonder and sadness in all who came there,
because they were great friends of theirs, and because they did
not know the cause that held them in such wise; but he that wondered
most was Aurelio, because he said that he had left them
so recently in Darinto's company with tokens of all pleasure
and happiness, so that apparently he had not been the cause of
all their misery. Erastro then seeing that the shepherds were
coming to him, shook Elicio, saying to him:</p>

<p>'Come to yourself, hapless shepherd, arise, and seek a spot
where you can by yourself bewail your misfortune, for I think to
do the same until life ends.'</p>

<p>And saying this he took in his two hands Elicio's head and,
putting it off his knees, set it on the ground, without the shepherd
being able to return to consciousness; and Erastro, rising,
was turning his back to go away, had not Thyrsis and Damon
and the other shepherds, kept him from it. Damon went to
where Elicio was, and taking him in his arms, made him come
to himself. Elicio opened his eyes, and, because he knew all
who were there, he took care that his tongue, moved and constrained
by grief, should not say anything that might declare
the cause of it: and, though this was asked of him by all the shepherds,
he never gave any answer save that he knew naught of
himself but that, as he was speaking with Erastro, a severe
fainting fit had seized him. Erastro said the same, and for this
reason the shepherds ceased to ask him further the reason of his
affliction, but rather they asked him to return with them to
Silerio's hermitage and to let them take him thence to the village
or to his hut: but it was not possible for them to prevail with
him in this beyond letting him return to the village. Seeing then
that this was his desire, they did not wish to oppose it, but
rather offered to go with him, but he wished no one's company,
nor would he have accepted it, had not his friend Damon's persistence
overcome him, and so he had to depart with him,
Damon having agreed with Thyrsis to see each other that night in
the village or Elicio's hut, in order to arrange to return to theirs.
Aurelio and Timbrio asked Erastro for Darinto, and he told
them in reply that as soon as Aurelio had left them the fainting
fit had seized Elicio, and whilst he was tending to him, Darinto
had departed with all haste, and they had seen him no more.
Timbrio and those who came with him, seeing then that they did
not find Darinto, determined to return to the hermitage and
beg Silerio to accept the fair Blanca as his wife; and with this
intention they all returned except Erastro, who wished to follow
his friend Elicio; and so, taking leave of them, accompanied
only by his rebeck, he went away by the same road Elicio had
gone. The latter, having gone some distance away with his friend
Damon from the rest of the company, with tears in his eyes, and
with tokens of the greatest sadness, began to speak to him thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>'I know well, discreet Damon, that you have so much experience
of love's effects that you will not wonder at what I now
think to tell you, for they are such that in the reckoning of my
judgment I count them and hold them among the most disastrous
that are found in love.'</p>

<p>Damon who desired nothing else than to learn the cause of
his fainting and sadness, assured him that nothing would be
new to him, if it touched on the evils love is wont to cause.
And so Elicio with this assurance and with the assurance yet
greater he had of his friendship, went on, saying:</p>

<p>'You already know, friend Damon, how my good fortune, for
I will always give it this name of good, though it cost me life to
have had it&mdash;I say then, that my good fortune willed, as all Heaven
and all these banks know, that I should love&mdash;do I say love?&mdash;adore
the peerless Galatea with a love as pure and true as befits
her deserving. At the same time I confess to you, friend, that
in all the time she has known my just desire, she has not
responded to it with other tokens save those general ones which
a chaste and grateful breast is wont and ought to give. And so
for some years, my hope being sustained by intercourse both
honourable and loving, I have lived so joyous and satisfied with
my thoughts, that I judged myself the happiest shepherd that
ever pastured flock, contenting myself merely with looking at
Galatea and with seeing that if she did not love me, she did not
loathe me, and that no other shepherd could boast that he was
even looked at by her, for it was no small satisfaction of my
desire to have set my thoughts on an object so secure that I had
no fear of anyone else, being confirmed in this truth by the
opinion which Galatea's worth inspires in me, which is such
that it gives no opportunity for boldness itself to make bold with
it. Against this good, which love gave me at so little a cost,
against this glory enjoyed so much without harm to Galatea,
against the pleasure so justly deserved by my desire, irrevocable
sentence has to-day been passed, that the good should end, the
glory finish, the pleasure be changed, and that finally the
tragedy of my mournful life should be closed. For you must
know, Damon, that this morning, as I came with Aurelio,
Galatea's father, to seek you at Sileno's hermitage, he told me
on the way how he had arranged to marry Galatea to a Lusitanian
shepherd who pastures numerous herds on the banks of
the gentle Lima. He asked me to tell him what I thought
because, from the friendship he had for me, and from my
understanding, he hoped to be well counselled. What I said to
him in reply was that it seemed to me a hard thing to be able
to bring his will to deprive itself of the sight of so fair a daughter,
banishing her to such distant regions, and that if he did so,
carried away and tempted by the bait of the strange shepherd's
wealth, he should consider that he did not lack it so much that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
he was not able to live in his village better than all in it who
claimed to be rich, and that none of the best of those who dwell
on the banks of the Tagus, would fail to count himself fortunate
when he should win Galatea to wife. My words were not ill
received by the venerable Aurelio, but at last he made up his
mind, saying that the chief herdsman of all the flocks bade him
do it,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and he it was who had arranged and settled it, and that it
was impossible to withdraw. I asked him with what countenance
Galatea had received the news of her banishment. He
told me that she had conformed to his will and was disposing
hers to do all he wished, like an obedient daughter. This I
learned from Aurelio, and this, Damon, is the cause of my
fainting, and will be that of my death, since at seeing Galatea in
a stranger's power and a stranger to my sight, naught else can
be hoped for save the end of my days.'</p>

<p>The love-sick Elicio ended his words and his tears began,
shed in such abundance that the breast of his friend Damon,
moved to compassion, could not but accompany him in them.
But after a little while he began with the best reasons he could
to console Elicio, but all his words stopped at being words
without producing any effect. Nevertheless they agreed
that Elicio should speak to Galatea and learn from her if she
consented of her will to the marriage her father was arranging
for her, and that, should it not be to her liking, an offer should
be made to her to free her from that constraint, since help
would not fail her in it. What Damon was saying seemed good
to Elicio, and he determined to go to look for Galatea to declare
to her his wish, and to learn the wish she held enclosed in her
breast; and so, changing the road they were taking to his cabin,
they journeyed towards the village, and coming to a crossway
hard by where four roads divided, they saw some eight gallant
shepherds approaching by one of them, all with javelins in their
hands, except one of them who came mounted on a handsome
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span>mare, clad in a violet cloak, and the rest on foot, all having
their faces muffled with kerchiefs. Damon and Elicio stopped
till the shepherds should pass, and these passing close to them,
bowed their heads and courteously saluted them, without any of
them saying a word. The two were amazed to see the strange
appearance of the eight, and stood still to see what road they were
following; but straightway they saw they were taking the road to
the village, although a different one to that by which they were
going. Damon told Elicio to follow them, but he would not, saying
that on that way which he wished to follow, near a spring which
was not far from it, Galatea was ofttime wont to be with some
shepherdesses of the village, and that it would be well to see if
fortune showed herself so kind to them that they might find her
there. Damon was satisfied with what Elicio wished, and so he
told him to lead wherever he chose. And his lot chanced as
he himself had imagined, for they had not gone far when there
came to their ears the pipe of Florisa, accompanied by the fair
Galatea's voice, and when this was heard by the shepherds,
they were beside themselves. Then Damon knew at last how
true they spoke who celebrated the graces of Galatea, who was
in the company of Rosaura and Florisa and of the fair Silveria
newly wed, with two other shepherdesses of the same village.
And though Galatea saw the shepherds coming, she would not
for that reason abandon the song she had begun, but rather
seemed to give tokens that she felt pleasure at the shepherds
listening to her, and they did so with all the attention possible;
and what they succeeded in hearing of what the shepherdess was
singing, was the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p class="p01">Galatea sang no more, for the tears she was shedding
hindered her voice, and even the satisfaction in all those who
had been listening to her, for they straightway knew clearly
what they were dimly imagining concerning Galatea's marriage
with the Lusitanian shepherd, and how much it was being
brought about against her will. But he whom her tears and
sighs moved most to pity was Elicio, for he would have given
his life to remedy them, had their remedy depended thereon;
but making use of his discretion, his face dissembling the grief
his soul was feeling, he and Damon went up to where the
shepherdesses were, whom they courteously greeted, and with
no less courtesy were received by them. Galatea straightway
asked Damon for her father, and he replied to her that he was
staying in Silerio's hermitage, in the company of Timbrio and
Nisida, and of all the other shepherds who accompanied
Timbrio, and he likewise gave her an account of the recognition
of Silerio and Timbrio, and of the loves of Darinto and
Blanca, Nisida's sister, with all the details Timbrio had related
of what had happened to him in the course of his love, whereon
Galatea said:</p>

<p>'Happy Timbrio and happy Nisida, since the unrest suffered
until now has ended in such felicity, wherewith you will set in
oblivion the past disasters! nay, it will serve to increase your
glory, since it is a saying that the memory of past calamities
adds to the happiness that comes from present joys. But woe
for the hapless soul, that sees itself brought to the pass of
recalling lost bliss, and with fear of the ill that is to come;
without seeing nor finding remedy, nor any means to check the
misfortune which is threatening it, since griefs distress the more
the more they are feared!'</p>

<p>'You speak truth, fair Galatea,' said Damon, 'for there is no
doubt that the sudden and unexpected grief that comes, does
not distress so much, though it alarms, as that which threatens
during long lapse of time, and closes up all the ways of remedy.
But nevertheless I say, Galatea, that Heaven does not send
evils so much without alloy, as to take away their remedy
altogether, especially when it lets us see them coming first, for
it seems that then it wishes to give an opportunity for the
working of our reason, in order that it may exercise and busy
itself in tempering or turning aside the misfortunes about to
come, and often it contents itself with distressing us by merely
keeping our minds busied with some specious fear without the
accomplishment of the dreaded evil being reached; and though
it should be reached, so long as life does not end, no one should
despair of the remedy for any evil he may suffer.'</p>

<p>'I do not doubt of this,' replied Galatea, 'if the evils which
are dreaded or suffered were so slight, as to leave free and
unimpeded the working of our intellect; but you know well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>
Damon, that when the evil is such that this name can be given
to it, the first thing it does is to cloud our perception, and to
destroy the powers of our free will, our vigour decaying in such
a way that it can scarce lift itself, though hope urge it the
more.'</p>

<p>'I do not know, Galatea,' answered Damon, 'how in your
green years can be contained such experience of evils, if it is
not that you wish us to understand that your great discretion
extends to speaking from intuitive knowledge of things, for you
have no information concerning them in any other way.'</p>

<p>'Would to Heaven, discreet Damon,' replied Galatea, 'that I
were not able to contradict you in what you say, since thereby I
would gain two things: to retain the good opinion you have of
me, and not to feel the pain which causes me to speak with so
much experience of it.'</p>

<p>Up to this point Elicio had kept silence; but being unable
any longer to endure seeing Galatea give tokens of the bitter
grief she was suffering, he said to her:</p>

<p>'If you think perchance, peerless Galatea, that the woe that
threatens you can by any chance be remedied, by what you owe
to the good-will to serve you which you have known in me, I beg
you to declare it to me; and if you should not wish this so as to
comply with what you owe to obedience to your father, give me
at least leave to oppose anyone who should wish to carry away
from us from these banks the treasure of your beauty, which has
been nurtured thereon. And do not think, shepherdess, that I
presume so much on myself, as alone to make bold to fulfil with
deeds what I now offer you in words, for though the love I bear
you gives me spirit for a greater enterprise, I distrust my
fortune, and so I must needs place it in the hands of reason,
and in those of all the shepherds that pasture their flocks on these
banks of Tagus, who will not be willing to suffer that the sun
that illumines them, the discretion that makes them marvel, the
beauty that incites them and inspires them to a thousand honourable
rivalries should be snatched and taken away from before
their eyes. Wherefore, fair Galatea, on the faith of the reason
I have expressed, and of that which I have for adoring you, I
make you this offer, which must needs constrain you to disclose
your wish to me, in order that I may not fall into the error of
going against it in anything; but considering that your matchless
goodness and modesty must needs move you to respond
rather to your father's desire than to your own, I do not wish,
shepherdess, that you should tell it me, but to undertake to do
what shall seem good to me, with the purpose of looking after
your honour, with the care with which you yourself have always
looked after it.'</p>

<p>Galatea was going to reply to Elicio and to thank him for his
kind desire; but she was prevented by the sudden coming of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
the eight masked shepherds whom Damon and Elicio had seen
passing toward the village a little while before. All came to
where the shepherdesses were, and without speaking a word,
six of them rushed with incredible speed to close with Damon
and Elicio, holding them in so strong a clutch that they could
in no way release themselves. In the meanwhile the other two
(one of whom was the one who came on horseback) went to
where Rosaura was, shrieking by reason of the violence that
was being done to Damon and Elicio; but, without any defence
availing her, one of the shepherds took her in his arms, and
placed her on the mare, and in the arms of the one who was
mounted. He, removing his mask, turned to the shepherds and
shepherdesses, saying:</p>

<p>'Do not wonder, good friends, at the wrong which seemingly
has here been done you, for the power of love and this lady's
ingratitude have been the cause of it. I pray you to forgive
me, since it is no longer in my control; and if the famous
Grisaldo comes through these parts (as I believe he soon will
come), you will tell him that Artandro is carrying off Rosaura,
because he could not endure to be mocked by her, and that, if
love and this wrong should move him to wish for vengeance, he
already knows that Aragón is my country, and the place where
I live.'</p>

<p>Rosaura was in a swoon on the saddle-bow, and the other
shepherds would not let Elicio or Damon go, until Artandro
bade them let them go; and when they saw themselves free,
they drew their knives with valiant spirit and rushed upon the
seven shepherds, who all together held the javelins they were
carrying at their breasts, telling them to stop, since they saw
how little they could achieve in the enterprise they were
undertaking.</p>

<p>'Still less can Artandro achieve,' Elicio said in reply to
them, 'in having wrought such treason.'</p>

<p>'Call it not treason,' answered one of the others, 'for this lady
has given her word to be Artandro's wife, and now, to comply
with the fickle mood of woman, she has withdrawn it, and
yielded herself to Grisaldo, a wrong so manifest and such that
it could not be dissembled from our master Artandro. Therefore
calm yourselves, shepherds, and think better of us than hitherto,
since to serve our master in so just a cause excuses us.'</p>

<p>And without saying more, they turned their backs, still mistrusting
the evil looks Elicio and Damon wore, who were in such
a rage at not being able to undo that violent act, and at finding
themselves incapacitated from avenging what was being done
to them, that they knew neither what to say nor what to do.
But the sufferings Galatea and Florisa endured at seeing Rosaura
carried away in that manner, were such that they moved Elicio
to set his life in the manifest peril of losing it; for, drawing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
his sling&mdash;and Damon doing the same&mdash;he went at full speed in
pursuit of Artandro, and with much spirit and skill they began
from a distance to throw such large stones at them that they
made them halt and turn to set themselves on the defensive.
But nevertheless it could not but have gone ill with the two bold
shepherds, had not Artandro bidden his men to go forward and
leave them, as they did, until they entered a dense little thicket
which was on one side of the road, and, with the protection of
the trees the slings and stones of the angry shepherds had little
effect. Nevertheless they would have followed them, had they
not seen Galatea and Florisa and the other two shepherdesses
coming with all haste to where they were, and for this reason
they stopped, violently restraining the rage that spurred them on,
and the desired vengeance they meditated; and as they went
forward to receive Galatea, she said to them:</p>

<p>'Temper your wrath, gallant shepherds, since with the advantage
of our enemies your diligence cannot vie, though it has been
such as the valour of your souls has shown to us.'</p>

<p>'The sight of your discontent, Galatea,' said Elicio, 'would,
I believed, have given such violent energy to mine, that those
discourteous shepherds would not have boasted of the violence
they have done us; but in my fortune is involved not having any
luck in anything I desire.'</p>

<p>'The loving desire Artandro feels' said Galatea, 'it was which
moved him to such discourtesy, and so he is in my eyes excused
in part.'</p>

<p>And straightway she related to them in full detail the story of
Rosaura, and how she was waiting for Grisaldo to receive him as
husband, which might have come to Artandro's knowledge, and
that jealous rage might have moved him to do as they had seen.</p>

<p>'If it is as you say, discreet Galatea,' said Damon, 'I fear that
from Grisaldo's neglect, and Artandro's boldness, and Rosaura's
fickle mood, some grief and strife must needs arise.'</p>

<p>'That might be,' replied Galatea, 'should Artandro dwell in
Castile; but if he withdraws to Aragón, which is his country,
Grisaldo will be left with only the desire for vengeance.'</p>

<p>'Is there no one to inform him of this wrong?' said Elicio.</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Florisa, 'for I pledge myself that before night
approaches, he shall have knowledge of it.'</p>

<p>'If that were so,' replied Damon, 'he would be able to recover
his beloved before they reached Aragón; for a loving breast is
not wont to be slothful.'</p>

<p>'I do not think that Grisaldo's will be so,' said Florisa, 'and,
that time and opportunity to show it may not fail him, I pray
you, Galatea, let us return to the village, for I wish to send to
inform Grisaldo of his misfortune.'</p>

<p>'Be it done as you bid, friend,' replied Galatea, 'for I shall
give you a shepherd to take the news.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>And with this they were about to take leave of Damon and
Elicio, had not these persisted in their wish to go with them.
And as they were journeying to the village, they heard on their
right hand the pipe, straightway recognised by all, of Erastro,
who was coming in pursuit of his friend Elicio. They stopped
to listen to it, and heard him singing thus, as he came, with
tokens of tender grief:</p>

<p class="p01">E<small>RASTRO.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">By rugged paths my fancy's doubtful end</span><br />
I follow, to attain it ever trying,<br />
And in night's gloom and chilly darkness lying,<br />
The forces of my life I ever spend.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">To leave the narrow way, I do not lend</span><br />

</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">With a deep sigh the hapless shepherd ended his loving song,
and, believing that no one heard him, loosed his voice in words
such as these:</p>

<p>'Oh Love, whose mighty power, though exercising no constraint
upon my soul, brought it to pass that I should have
power to keep my thoughts busied so well, seeing that thou
hast done me so much good, seek not now to show thyself
doing me the ill wherewith thou threatenest me! for thy mood
is more changeable than that of fickle fortune. Behold, Lord,
how obedient I have been to thy laws, how ready to follow thy
behests, and how subservient I have kept my will to thine!
Reward me for this obedience by doing what is to thee of such
import to do; suffer not these banks of ours to be bereft of that
beauty which set beauty and bestowed beauty on their fresh
and tiny grasses, on their lowly plants, and lofty trees; consent
not, Lord, that from the clear Tagus be taken away the treasure
that enriches it, and from which it has more fame than from
the golden sands it nurtures in its bosom; take not away from
the shepherds of these meadows the light of their eyes, the
glory of their thoughts, and the noble incentive that spurred
them on to a thousand noble and virtuous enterprises; consider
well that, if thou dost consent that Galatea should be
taken from this to foreign lands, thou despoilest thyself of the
dominion thou hast on these banks, since thou dost exercise it
through Galatea alone; and if she is wanting, count it assured
that thou wilt not be known in all these meadows; for all, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
many as dwell therein, will refuse thee obedience and will not
aid thee with the wonted tribute; mark that what I beg of thee
is so conformable and near to reason, that thou wouldst wholly
depart from it, if thou didst not grant me my request. For what
law ordains, or what reason consents that the beauty we have
nurtured, the discretion that had its beginning in these our woods
and villages, the grace granted by Heaven's especial gift to our
country, now that we were hoping to cull the honourable fruit of
so much wealth and riches, must needs be taken to foreign
realms to be possessed and dealt with by strange and unknown
hands? May piteous Heaven seek not to work us a harm so
noteworthy! Oh green meadows, that rejoiced at her sight, oh
sweet-smelling flowers, that, touched by her feet, were full of a
greater fragrance, oh plants, oh trees of this delightful wood!
make all of you in the best form you can, though it be not
granted to your nature, some kind of lamentation to move
Heaven to grant me what I beg!'</p>

<p>The love-sick shepherd said this, shedding the while such
tears that Galatea could not dissemble hers, nor yet any of those
who were with her, making all so noteworthy a lamentation, as
if then weeping at the rites of his death. Erastro came up to
them at this point and was received by them with pleasing
courtesy. And, as he saw Galatea with tokens of having accompanied
him in his tears, without taking his eyes from her, he
stood looking intently on her for a space, at the end of which he
said:</p>

<p>'Now I know of a truth, Galatea, that no one of mankind
escapes the blows of fickle fortune, since I see that you who, I
thought, were to be by special privilege free from them, are
assailed and harassed by them with greater force. Hence I am
sure that Heaven has sought by a single blow to grieve all who
know you, and all who have any knowledge of your worth; but
nevertheless I cherish the hope that its cruelty is not to extend
so far as to carry further the affliction it has begun, coming as it
does so much to the hurt of your happiness.'</p>

<p>'Nay, for this same reason,' replied Galatea, 'I am less sure of
my misfortune, since I was never unfortunate in what I desired;
but, as it does not befit the modesty on which I pride myself, to
reveal so clearly how the obedience I owe to my parents draws
me after it by the hair, I pray you, Erastro, not to give me
cause to renew my grief, and that naught may be treated of
either by you or by anyone else that may awaken in me before
the time the memory of the distress I fear. And together with
this I also pray you, shepherds, to suffer me to go on to the
village in order that Grisaldo, being informed, may have time to
take satisfaction for the wrong Artandro has done him.'</p>

<p>Erastro was ignorant of Artandro's affair; but the shepherdess
Florisa in a few words told him it all; whereat Erastro won<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span>dered,
thinking that Artandro's valour could scarce be small,
since it was set on so difficult a task. The shepherds were on
the very point of doing what Galatea bade them, had they not
discovered at that moment all the company of gentlemen, shepherds
and ladies who were the night before in Silerio's hermitage.
They were coming with tokens of the greatest joy to the village,
bringing with them Silerio in a different garb and mind from
that he had had hitherto, for he had already abandoned that of a
hermit, changing it for that of a joyous bridegroom, as he
already was the fair Blanca's to the equal joy and satisfaction
of both, and of his good friends Timbrio and Nisida who persuaded
him to it, giving an end by that marriage to all his
miseries, and peace and quiet to the thoughts that distressed
him for Nisida's sake. And so, with the rejoicing such an issue
caused in them, they were all coming giving tokens thereof with
agreeable music, and discreet and loving songs, which they
ceased when they saw Galatea and the rest who were with her,
receiving one another with much pleasure and courtesy, Galatea
congratulating Silerio on what had happened to him, and Blanca
on her betrothal, and the same was done by the shepherds,
Damon, Elicio, and Erastro, who were warmly attached to
Silerio. As soon as the congratulations and courtesies between
them ceased, they agreed to pursue their way to the village, and
to lighten it, Thyrsis asked Timbrio to finish the sonnet he had
begun to repeat when he was recognised by Silerio. And Timbrio,
not refusing to do so, to the sound of the jealous Orfenio's
flute, with an exquisite and sweet voice sang it and finished it.
It was as follows:</p>

<p class="p01">T<small>IMBRIO.</small></p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"> My hope is builded on so sure a base</span><br />
That, though the fiercer blow the ruthless wind,<br />
It cannot shake the bonds that firmly bind,<br />
Such faith, such strength, such courage it displays.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far, far am I from finding any place</span><br />
For change within my firm and loving mind,<br />
For sooner life doth in my anguish find<br />
Its end draw nigh, than confidence decays.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">For, if amidst Love's conflict wavereth</span><br />
The love-sick breast, no sweet nor peaceful home<br />
To win from the same Love it meriteth.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though Scylla threaten and Charybdis foam,</span><br />
My breast the while, exultant in its faith,<br />
Braveth the sea, and claims from Love its doom.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">Timbrio's sonnet seemed good to the shepherds, and no less
the grace with which he had sung it; and it was such that they
begged him to repeat something else. But he excused himself
by telling his friend Silerio to answer for him in that affair, as he
had always done in others more dangerous. Silerio could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
fail to do what his friend bade him, and so, in the joy of seeing
himself in such a happy state, he sang what follows to the sound
of that same flute of Orfenio's:</p>

<p class="p01">S<small>ILERIO.</small></p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Heaven I give my thanks, since I have passed</span><br />
Safe through the perils of this doubtful sea,<br />
And to this haven of tranquillity,<br />
Although I knew not whither, I am cast.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now let the sails of care be furled at last,</span><br />
Let the poor gaping ship repairèd be,<br />
Let each fulfil the vows which erstwhile he<br />
With stricken face made to the angry blast.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I kiss the earth, and Heaven I adore,</span><br />
My fortune fair and joyous I embrace,<br />
Happy I call my fatal destiny.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now I my hapless neck rejoicing place</span><br />
In the new peerless gentle chain once more,<br />
With purpose new and loving constancy.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">Silerio ended, and begged Nisida to be kind enough to
gladden those fields with her song, and she, looking at her
beloved Timbrio, with her eyes asked leave of him to fulfil
what Silerio was asking of her, and as he gave it her with a look
too, she, without waiting further, with much charm and grace,
when the sound of Orfenio's flute ceased, to that of Orompo's
pipe sang this sonnet:</p>

<div class="p01">N<small>ISIDA.</small></div>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against his view am I, whoso doth swear</span><br />
That never did Love's happiness attain<br />
Unto the height attained by his cruel pain,<br />
Though fortune wait on bliss with tenderest care.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I know what bliss is, what misfortune drear,</span><br />
And what they do I know full well; 'tis plain<br />
That bliss the more builds up the thought again,<br />
The more Love's sorrow doth its strength impair.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw myself by bitter death embraced,</span><br />
When I was ill-informed by tidings ill;<br />
To the rude corsairs I became a prey.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cruel was the anguish, bitter was the taste</span><br />
Of sorrow, yet I know and prove that still<br />
Greater the joy is of this glad to-day.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">Galatea and Florisa were filled with wonder at the exquisite
voice of the fair Nisida, who, as it seemed to her
that Timbrio and those of his party had for the time taken
the lead in singing, did not wish her sister to be without
doing it; and so, without much pressing, with no less grace
than Nisida, beckoning to Orfenio to play his flute, to its sound
she sang in this wise:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p class="p01">B<small>LANCA.</small></p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just as if I in sandy Libya were</span><br />
Or in far frozen Scythia, I beheld<br />
Myself at times by glowing fire assailed<br />
That never cools, at times by chilly fear.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But hope, that makes our sorrow disappear,</span><br />
Although such different semblances it bore,<br />
Kept my life safe, well-guarded by its power,<br />
When it was strong, when it was weak and drear,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spent was the fury of the winter's chill,</span><br />
And, though the fire of Love its power retained,<br />
Yet the spring came which I had longed to see.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now in one happy moment I have gained</span><br />
The sweet fruit long desirèd by my will<br />
With bounteous tokens of sincerity.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">Blanca's voice and what she sang pleased the shepherds no
less than all the others they had heard. And when they were
about to give proof that all the skill was not contained in the
gentlemen of the court, and when Orompo, Crisio, Orfenio, and
Marsilio, moved almost by one and the same thought, began to
tune their instruments, they were forced to turn their heads
by a noise they perceived behind them, which was caused
by a shepherd who was furiously rushing through the thickets
of the green wood. He was recognised by all as the love-sick
Lauso, whereat Thyrsis marvelled, for the night before
he had taken leave of him, saying that he was going on a
business, to finish which meant to finish his grief, and to
begin his pleasure; and without saying more to him had
gone away with another shepherd his friend, nor did he
know what could have happened to him now that he was
journeying with so much haste. What Thyrsis said moved
Damon to seek to call Lauso, and so he called to him to come;
but seeing that he did not hear him, and that he was already with
great haste disappearing behind a hill, he went forward with all
speed, and from the top of another hill, called him again with
louder cries. Lauso hearing them, and knowing who called
him, could not but turn, and on coming up to Damon embraced
him with tokens of strange content, and so great that the proof
he gave of being happy made Damon marvel; and so he said to
him:</p>

<p>'What is it, friend Lauso? Have you by chance attained the
goal of your desires, or have they since yesterday conformed
with it in such a way that you are finding with ease what you
purpose?'</p>

<p>'Much greater is the good I have, Damon, true friend,'
replied Lauso; 'since the cause which to others is wont to be
one of despair and death has proved to me hope and life, and
this cause has been owing to a disdain and undeceiving,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
accompanied by a prudish grace, which I have seen in my
shepherdess, for it has restored me to my first condition. Now,
now, shepherd, my wearied neck does not feel the weighty yoke
of love, now the lofty fabric of thought that made me giddy has
vanished in my mind; now I shall return to the lost converse
of my friends, now the green grass, and sweet-smelling flowers
of these peaceful fields will seem to me what they are, now my
sighs will have truce, my tears a ford, and my turmoils repose.
Consider, therefore, Damon, if this is sufficient cause for me to
show myself happy and rejoicing.'</p>

<p>'Yes it is, Lauso,' replied Damon, 'but I fear that happiness
so suddenly born cannot be lasting, and I have already experienced
that every freedom that is begotten of disdain
vanishes like smoke, and straightway the loving purpose turns
again with greater haste to follow its purposings. Wherefore,
friend Lauso, may it please Heaven that your content may be
more secure than I fancy, and that you may enjoy for a long
time the freedom you proclaim, for I would rejoice not only
because of what I owe to our friendship, but also because I
should see an unwonted miracle in the desires of love.'</p>

<p>'Howsoever this may be, Damon,' replied Lauso, 'I now feel
myself free, and lord of my will, and that yours may satisfy
itself that what I say is true, consider what you wish me to do
in proof of it. Do you wish me to go away? Do you wish me
to visit no more the hut where you think the cause of my past
pains and present joys can be? I will do anything to satisfy
you.'</p>

<p>'The important point is that you, Lauso, should be satisfied,'
replied Damon, 'and I shall see that you are, if I see you six
days hence in this same frame of mind; and for the nonce I
seek naught else from you, save that you leave the road you
were taking and come with me to where all those shepherds
and ladies are waiting for us, and that you celebrate the joy you
feel by entertaining us with your song whilst we go to the
village.'</p>

<p>Lauso was pleased to do what Damon bade him, and so he
turned back with him at the time when Thyrsis was beckoning
to Damon to return; and when it came to pass that he and
Lauso came up, without wasting words of courtesy Lauso said:</p>

<p>'I do not come, sirs, for less than festivity and pleasure;
therefore if you would have any in listening to me, let Marsilio
sound his pipe, and prepare yourselves to hear what I never
thought my tongue would have cause to utter, nor yet my
thought to imagine.'</p>

<p>All the shepherds replied together that it would be a great
joy to them to hear him. And straightway Marsilio, moved by
the desire he had to listen to him, played his pipe, to the sound
of which Lauso began to sing in this wise:</p>

</div>

<p class="p01">Lauso sang no more, though what he had sung sufficed to fill
those present with wonder, for, as all knew that the day before
he was so much in love and so content to be so, it made them
marvel to see him in so short a space of time so changed and
so different from what he was wont to be. And having considered
this well, his friend Thyrsis said to him:</p>

<p>'I know not, friend Lauso, if I should congratulate you on
the bliss attained in such brief hours, for I fear that it cannot be
as firm and sure as you imagine; but nevertheless I am glad
that you enjoy, though it may be for a little while, the pleasure
that freedom when attained causes in the soul, since it might be
that knowing now how it should be valued, though you might
turn again to the broken chains and bonds, you would use
more force to break them, drawn by the sweetness and delight
a free understanding and an unimpassioned will enjoy.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>'Have no fear, discreet Thyrsis,' replied Lauso, 'that any
other new artifice may suffice for me to place once more my feet
in the stocks of love, nor count me so light and capricious but
that it has cost me, to set me in the state in which I am, countless
reflections, a thousand verified suspicions, a thousand fulfilled
promises made to Heaven, that I might return to the light
I had lost; and since in the light I now see how little I saw
before, I will strive to preserve it in the best way I can.'</p>

<p>'There will be no other way so good,' said Thyrsis, 'as not to
turn to look at what you leave behind, for you will lose, if you
turn, the freedom that has cost you so much, and you will
be left, as was left that heedless lover, with new causes for
ceaseless lament; and be assured, friend Lauso, that there is
not in the world a breast so loving, which disdain and needless
arrogance do not cool, and even cause to withdraw from its ill-placed
thoughts. And I am made to believe this truth the more,
knowing who Silena is, though you have never told it me, and
knowing also her fickle mood, her hasty impulses, and the
freedom, to give it no other name, of her inclinations, things
which, if she did not temper them and cloak them with the
peerless beauty wherewith Heaven has endowed her, would
have made her abhorred by all the world.'</p>

<p>'You speak truth, Thyrsis,' replied Lauso, 'for without any
doubt her remarkable beauty, and the appearances of incomparable
modesty wherewith she arrays herself are reasons why
she should be not only loved but adored by all that behold her.
And so no one should marvel that my free will has submitted to
enemies so strong and mighty; only it is right that one should
marvel at the way I have been able to escape from them, for
though I come from their hands so ill-treated, with will impaired,
understanding disturbed, and memory decayed, yet it
seems to me that I can conquer in the strife.'</p>

<p>The two shepherds did not proceed further in their discourse,
for at this moment they saw a fair shepherdess coming by the
very road they were going, and a little way from her a shepherd,
who was straightway recognised, for he was the old Arsindo,
and the shepherdess was Galercio's sister, Maurisa. And
when she was recognised by Galatea and Florisa, they understood
that she was coming with some message from Grisaldo to
Rosaura, and as the pair went forward to welcome her, Maurisa
came to embrace Galatea, and the old Arsindo greeted all the
shepherds, and embraced his friend Lauso, who had a great
desire to know what Arsindo had done after they told him that
he had gone off in pursuit of Maurisa. And when he was now
seen coming back with her, he straightway began to lose with
him and with all the character his white hairs had won for him,
and he would even have lost it altogether, had not those who
were there known so well from experience to what point and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>
how far the force of love extended, and so in the very ones
who blamed him he found excuses for his error. And it seems
that Arsindo, guessing what the shepherds guessed of him, as
though to satisfy and excuse his affection, said to them:</p>

<p>'Listen, shepherds, to one of the strangest love-affairs that
for many years can have been seen on these our banks, or on
others. I believe full well that you know, and we all know, the
renowned shepherd Lenio, him whose loveless disposition won
him the name of loveless, him who not many days ago, merely
to speak ill of love, dared to enter into rivalry with the famous
Thyrsis, who is present; him, I say, who never could move his
tongue, were it not to speak ill of love; him who with such
earnestness was wont to reprove those whom he saw distressed
by the pangs of love. He, then, being so open an enemy of
Love, has come to the pass that I am sure Love has no one who
follows him more earnestly, nor yet has he a vassal whom he
persecutes more, for he has made him fall in love with the loveless
Gelasia, that cruel shepherdess, who the other day, as you
saw, held the brother of this damsel' (pointing to Maurisa),
'who resembles her so closely in disposition, with the rope at
his throat, to finish at the hands of her cruelty his short and ill-starred
days. I say in a word, shepherds, that Lenio the loveless
is dying for the hard-hearted Gelasia, and for her he fills
the air with sighs and the earth with tears; and what is worse
in this is that it seems to me that Love has wished to avenge
himself on Lenio's rebellious heart, handing him over to the
hardest and most scornful shepherdess that has been seen; and
he knowing it, now seeks in all he says and does to reconcile
himself with Love; and in the same terms with which before he
abused him, he now exalts and honours him. And nevertheless,
neither is Love moved to favour him, nor Gelasia inclined to
heal him, as I have seen with my eyes; since, not many hours
ago, as I was coming in the company of this shepherdess, we
found him at the spring of slates stretched on the ground, his
face covered with a cold sweat, and his breast panting with
strange rapidity. I went up to him and recognised him, and
with the water of the spring sprinkled his face, whereat he
recovered his lost senses; and drawing close to him I asked
him the cause of his grief, which he told me without missing a
word, telling it me with such tender feeling, that he inspired it
in this shepherdess, in whom I think there never was contained
the sign of any compassion. He dwelt on Gelasia's cruelty, and
the love he had for her, and the suspicion that reigned in him
that Love had brought him to such a state to avenge himself at
one blow for the many wrongs he had done him. I consoled
him as best I could, and leaving him free from his past paroxysm,
I come accompanying this shepherdess, and to seek you, Lauso,
in order that, if you would be willing, we may return to our huts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>
for it is ten days since we left them, and it may be that our
herds feel our absence more than we do theirs.'</p>

<p>'I know not if I should tell you in reply, Arsindo,' replied
Lauso, 'that I believe you invite me rather out of compliment
than for anything else to return to our huts, having as much to
do in those of others, as your ten days' absence from me has
shown. But leaving on one side most of what I could say to
you thereon for a better time and opportunity, tell me again if it
is true what you say of Lenio; for if it is, I may declare that
Love has wrought in these days two of the greatest miracles he
has wrought in all the days of his life, namely, to subdue and
enslave Lenio's hard heart, and to set free mine which was so
subjected.'</p>

<p>'Look to what you are saying, friend Lauso,' then said
Orompo, 'for if Love held you subject, as you have indicated
hitherto, how has the same Love now set you in the freedom
you proclaim?'</p>

<p>'If you would understand me, Orompo,' replied Lauso, 'you
will see that I in no wise contradict myself, for I say, or mean to
say, that the love that reigned and reigns in the breast of her
whom I loved so dearly, as it directs itself to a purpose different
from mine, though it is all love,&mdash;the effect it has wrought in me
is to place me in freedom and Lenio in slavery; and do not
compel me, Orompo, to relate other miracles with these.'</p>

<p>And as he said this he turned his eyes to look at the old
Arsindo, and with them uttered what with his tongue he kept
back; for all understood that the third miracle he might have
related would have been the sight of Arsindo's gray hairs in
love with the few green years of Maurisa. She was talking
apart all this time with Galatea and Florisa, telling them that on
the morrow Grisaldo would be in the village in shepherd's garb,
and that he thought there to wed Rosaura in secret, for publicly
he could not, because the kinsmen of Leopersia, to whom his
father had agreed to marry him, had learned that Grisaldo was
about to fail in his plighted word, and they in no wise wished
such a wrong to be done them; but nevertheless Grisaldo was
determined to conform rather to what he owed to Rosaura than
to the obligation in which he stood to his father.</p>

<p>'All that I have told you, shepherdesses,' went on Maurisa,
'my brother Galercio told me to tell you. He was coming to
you with this message, but the cruel Gelasia whose beauty ever
draws after it the soul of my luckless brother, was the cause why
he could not come to tell you what I have said, since, in order
to follow her, he ceased to follow the way he was taking, trusting
in me as a sister. You have now learned, shepherdesses, why I
have come. Where is Rosaura to tell it her? or do you tell it
her, for the anguish in which my brother lies does not permit
me to remain here a moment longer.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>Whilst the shepherdess was saying this, Galatea was considering
the grievous reply she intended to give her, and the sad
tidings that must needs reach the ears of the luckless Grisaldo;
but seeing that she could not escape giving them, and that
it was worse to detain her, she straightway told her all that
had happened to Rosaura, and how Artandro was carrying her
off; whereat Maurisa was amazed, and at once would fain have
returned to tell Grisaldo, had not Galatea detained her, asking
her what had become of the two shepherdesses who had gone
away with her and Galercio, to which Maurisa replied:</p>

<p>'I might tell you things about them, Galatea, which would set
you in greater wonder than that in which Rosaura's fate has set
me, but time does not give me opportunity for it. I only tell
you that she who was called Leonarda has betrothed herself to
my brother Artidoro by the subtlest trick that has ever been
seen; and Teolinda, the other one, is in the pass of ending her
life or of losing her wits, and she is only sustained by the sight
of Galercio, for, as his appearance resembles so much that of my
brother Artidoro, she does not depart from his company for a
moment, a thing which is as irksome and vexatious to Galercio
as the company of the cruel Gelasia is sweet and pleasing to
him. The manner in which this took place I will tell you more
in detail, when we see each other again; for it will not be right
that by my delay the remedy should be hindered, that Grisaldo
may have in his misfortune, using to remedy it all diligence
possible. For, if it is only this morning that Artandro carried
off Rosaura, he will not have been able to go so far from these
banks as to take away from Grisaldo the hope of recovering her,
and more so if I quicken my steps as I intend.'</p>

<p>Galatea approved of what Maurisa was saying, and so she did
not wish to detain her longer; only she begged her to be kind
enough to return to see her as soon as she could, to relate to her
what had happened to Teolinda, and what had happened in
Rosaura's affair. The shepherdess promised it her, and without
staying longer, took leave of those who were there, and returned
to her village, leaving all contented with her charm and beauty.
But he who felt her departure most was the old Arsindo, who,
not to give clear tokens of his desire, had to remain as lonely
without Maurisa as he was accompanied by his thoughts. The
shepherdesses, too, were left amazed at what they had heard
about Teolinda, and desired exceedingly to learn her fate;
and, whilst in this state, they heard the clear sound of a horn,
which was sounding on their right hand, and turning their
eyes to that side, they saw on the top of a hill of some height
two old shepherds who had between them an aged priest,
whom they straightway knew to be the old Telesio. And, one
of the shepherds having blown the horn a second time, the three
all descended from the hill and journeyed towards another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[Pg 236]</span>
which was hard by, and having ascended it, they again blew the
horn, at the sound of which many shepherds began to move
from different parts to come to see what Telesio desired; for by
that signal he was wont to call together all the shepherds of that
bank whenever he wished to address to them some useful
discourse, or to tell them of the death of some renowned shepherd
in those parts, or in order to bring to their minds the day
of some solemn festival or of some sad funeral rites. Aurelio
then, and almost all the shepherds who came there, having
recognised Telesio's costume and calling, all came on, drawing
nigh to where he was, and when they got there, they were
already united in one group. But, as Telesio saw so many
people coming, and recognised how important all were,
descending from the hill, he went to receive them with much
love and courtesy, and with the same courtesy was received by
all. And Aurelio, going up to Telesio, said to him:</p>

<p>'Tell us, if you be so good, honourable and venerable Telesio,
what new cause moves you to wish to assemble the shepherds
of these meadows; is it by chance for joyous festival or sad
funereal rite? Do you wish to point out to us something appertaining
to the improvement of our lives? Tell us, Telesio, what
your will ordains, since you know that ours will not depart from
all that yours might wish.'</p>

<p>'May Heaven repay you, shepherds,' answered Telesio, 'for
the sincerity of your purposes, since they conform so much to
that of him who seeks only your good and profit. But to satisfy
the desire you have to learn what I wish, I wish to bring to your
memory the memory you ought ever to retain of the worth and
fame of the famous and excellent shepherd Meliso, whose
mournful obsequies are renewed and ever will be renewed from
year to year on to-morrow's date so long as there be shepherds
on our banks, and in our souls there be not wanting the knowledge
of what is due to Meliso's goodness and worth. At least
for myself I can tell you that, as long as my life shall last, I
shall not fail to remind you at the fitting time of the obligation
under which you have been placed by the skill, courtesy, and
virtue of the peerless Meliso. And so now I remind you of it
and make known to you that to-morrow is the day when the
luckless day must be renewed on which we lost so much good,
as it was to lose the agreeable presence of the prudent shepherd
Meliso. By what you owe to his goodness, and by what you owe
to the purpose I have to serve you, I pray you shepherds to be
to-morrow at break of day all in the valley of cypresses, where
stands the tomb of Meliso's honoured ashes, in order that there
with sad hymns and pious sacrifices we may seek to lighten the
pain, if any it suffers, of that happy soul which has left us in such
solitude.'</p>

<p>And as he said this, moved by the tender regret the memory of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span>
Meliso's death caused him, his venerable eyes filled with tears,
most of the bystanders accompanying him therein. They all
with one accord offered to be present on the morrow where
Telesio bade them, and Timbrio and Silerio, Nisida and
Blanca did the same, for it seemed to them that it would not
be well to fail to attend at so solemn an occasion and in an
assembly of shepherds so celebrated as they imagined would
assemble there. Therewith they took leave of Telesio and
resumed the journey to the village they had begun. But they
had not gone far from that place when they saw coming
towards them the loveless Lenio, with a countenance so sad
and thoughtful that it set wonder in all; and he was coming so
rapt in his fancies that he passed by the side of the shepherds
without seeing them; nay, rather, turning his course to the left
hand, he had not gone many steps when he flung himself down
at the foot of a green willow; and giving forth a heavy and
deep sigh, he raised his hand, and placing it on the collar of
his skin-coat, pulled so strongly that he tore it all the way down,
and straightway he took the wallet from his side, and drawing
from it a polished rebeck, he set himself to tune it with great
attention and calm; and after a little while he began in a
mournful and harmonious voice to sing in such a manner that
he constrained all who had seen him to stop to listen to him
until the end of his song, which was as follows:</p>

</div>

<p class="p01">Little it was that Lenio sang, but his flood of tears was so
copious that he would there have been consumed in them, had
not the shepherds come up to console him. But when he saw
them coming and recognised Thyrsis among them, he arose
without further delay and went to fling himself at his feet,
closely embracing his knees, and said to him without ceasing
his tears:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>'Now you can, famous shepherd, take just vengeance for the
boldness I had to compete with you, defending the unjust cause
my ignorance set before me; now, I say, you can raise your
arm and with a sharp knife pierce this heart where was contained
foolishness so notorious as it was not to count Love the
universal lord of the world. But one thing I would have you
know, that if you wish to take vengeance duly on my error, you
should leave me with the life I sustain, which is such that there
is no death to compare to it.'</p>

<p>Thyrsis had already raised the hapless Lenio from the ground,
and having embraced him, sought to console him with discreet
and loving words, saying to him:</p>

<p>'The greatest fault there is in faults, friend Lenio, is to persist
in them, for it is the disposition of devils never to repent of
errors committed, and likewise one of the chief causes which
moves and constrains men to pardon offences is for the offended
one to see repentance in the one who gives offence, and the
more when the pardoning is in the hands of one who does
nothing in doing this act, since his noble disposition draws and
compels him to do it, he remaining richer and more satisfied
with the pardon than with the vengeance; as we see it repeatedly
in great lords and kings, who gain more glory in
pardoning wrongs than in avenging them. And since you,
Lenio, confess the error in which you have been and now know
the mighty forces of Love, and understand of him that he is the
universal lord of our hearts, by reason of this new knowledge
and of the repentance you feel, you can be confident and live
assured that gentle and kindly Love will soon restore you to a
calm and loving life; for if he now punishes you by giving you
the painful life you lead, he does it so that you may know him
and may afterwards hold and esteem more highly the life of joy
he surely thinks to give you.'</p>

<p>To these words Elicio and the remaining shepherds who were
there, added many others whereby it seemed that Lenio was
somewhat more consoled. And straightway he related to them
how he was dying for the cruel shepherdess Gelasia, emphasising
to them the scornful and loveless disposition of hers, and how
free and exempt she was from thinking on any goal in love,
describing to them also the insufferable torment which for her
sake the gentle shepherd Galercio was suffering, on whom she
set so little store that a thousand times she had set him on the
verge of suicide. But after they had for a while discoursed on
these things, they resumed their journey, taking Lenio with
them, and without anything else happening to them they reached
the village, Elicio taking with him Thyrsis, Damon, Erastro,
Lauso and Arsindo. With Daranio went Crisio, Orfenio,
Marsilio, and Orompo. Florisa and the other shepherdesses
went with Galatea and her father Aurelio, having first agreed
that on the morrow at the coming of the dawn they should meet
to go to the valley of cypresses as Telesio had bidden them, in
order to celebrate Meliso's obsequies. At them, as has already
been said, Timbrio, Silerio, Nisida and Blanca wished to be
present, who went that night with the venerable Aurelio.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BOOK VI.</h2>



<p>Scarce had the rays of golden Phoebus begun to break through
the lowest line of our horizon, when the aged and venerable
Telesio made the piteous sound of his horn come to the ears of
all that were in the village&mdash;a signal which moved those who
heard it to leave the repose of their pastoral couches, and
hasten to do what Telesio bade. But the first who led the way
in this were Elicio, Aurelio, Daranio, and all the shepherds and
shepherdesses who were with them, the fair Nisida and Blanca,
and the happy Timbrio and Silerio not being absent, with a
number of other gallant shepherds and beauteous shepherdesses,
who joined them, and might reach the number of thirty.
Amongst them went the peerless Galatea, new miracle of beauty,
and the lately-wed Silveria, who brought with her the fair and
haughty Belisa, for whom the shepherd Marsilio suffered such
loving and mortal pangs. Belisa had come to visit Silveria, and
to congratulate her on her newly attained estate, and she wished
likewise to be present at obsequies so celebrated as she hoped
those would be that shepherds so great and so famous were
celebrating. All then came out together from the village,
outside which they found Telesio, with many other shepherds
accompanying him, all clad and adorned in such wise that they
clearly showed that they had come together for a sad and
mournful business. Straightway Telesio ordained, so that the
solemn sacrifices might that day be performed with purer intent
and thoughts more calm, that all the shepherds should come
together on their side, and apart from the shepherdesses, and that
the latter should do the same: whereat the smaller number were
content, and the majority not very satisfied, especially the fond
Marsilio, who had already seen the loveless Belisa, at sight of
whom he was so beside himself and so rapt, as his friends
Orompo, Crisio, and Orfenio clearly perceived, and when they
saw him in such a state, they went up to him, and Orompo said
to him:</p>

<p>'Take courage, friend Marsilio, take courage, and do not by
your faint-heartedness cause the small spirit of your breast to be
revealed. What if Heaven, moved to compassion of your pain,
has at such a time brought the shepherdess Belisa to these
banks that you may heal it?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>'Nay rather the better to end me, as I believe,' replied
Marsilio, 'will she have come to this place, for this and more
must needs be feared from my fortune; but I will do, Orompo,
what you bid, if by chance in this hard plight reason has more
power with me than my feelings.'</p>

<p>And therewith Marsilio became again somewhat more calm,
and straightway the shepherds on one side, and the shepherdesses
on another, as was ordained by Telesio, began to make their
way to the valley of cypresses, all preserving a wondrous
silence; until Timbrio, astonished to see the coolness and
beauty of the clear Tagus by which he was going, turned to
Elicio who was coming at his side, and said to him:</p>

<p>'The incomparable beauty of these cool banks, Elicio, causes
me no small wonder; and not without reason, for when one has
seen as I have the spacious banks of the renowned Betis, and
those that deck and adorn the famous Ebro, and the well-known
Pisuerga, and when one in foreign lands has walked by the
banks of the holy Tiber, and the pleasing banks of the Po,
made noted by the fall of the rash youth, and has not failed
to go round the cool spots of the peaceful Sebeto, it must needs
have been a great cause that should move me to wonder at seeing
any others.'</p>

<p>'You do not go so far out of the way in what you say, as I
believe, discreet Timbrio,' answered Elicio, 'as not to see with
your eyes how right you are to say it; for without doubt you
can believe that the pleasantness and coolness of the banks of
this river excel, as is well known and recognised, all those you
have named, though there should enter among them those of
the distant Xanthus, and of the renowned Amphrysus, and of
the loving Alpheus. For experience holds and has made certain,
that almost in a straight line above the greater part of these
banks appears a sky bright and shining, which with a wide
sweep and with living splendour seems to invite to joy and gladness
the heart that is most estranged from it; and if it is true
that the stars and the sun are sustained, as some say, by the
waters here below, I firmly believe that those of this river are in a
large measure the cause that produces the beauty of the sky that
covers it, or I shall believe that God, for the same reason that
they say He dwells in Heaven, makes here His sojourn for the most
part. The earth that embraces it, clad with a thousand green
adornments, seems to make festival and to rejoice at possessing
in itself a gift so rare and pleasing, and the golden river as
though in exchange, sweetly interweaving itself in its embraces,
fashions, as if with intent, a thousand windings in and out,
which fill the soul of all who behold them with wondrous
pleasure; whence it arises that, though the eyes turn again to
behold it many a time, they do not therefore fail to find in it
things to cause them new pleasure and new wonder. Turn your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
eyes then, valiant Timbrio, and see how much its banks are
adorned by the many villages and wealthy farmhouses, which
are seen built along them. Here in every season of the year is
seen the smiling spring in company with fair Venus, her garments
girded up and full of love, and Zephyrus accompanying
her, with his mother Flora in front, scattering with bounteous
hand divers fragrant flowers; and the skill of its inhabitants
has wrought so much that nature, incorporated with art, is
become an artist and art's equal, and from both together has
been formed a third nature to which I cannot give a name. Of
its cultivated gardens, compared with which the gardens of the
Hesperides and of Alcinous, may keep silence, of the dense woods,
of the peaceful olives, green laurels, and rounded myrtles, of its
abundant pastures, joyous valleys, and covered hills, streamlets
and springs which are found on this bank, do not expect me to
say more, save that, if in any part of the earth the Elysian fields
have a place, it is without doubt here. What shall I say of the
skilful working of the lofty wheels, by the ceaseless motion of
which men draw the waters from the deep river, and copiously
irrigate the fields which are distant a long way? Let there be
added to this that on these banks are nurtured the fairest and
most discreet shepherdesses that can be found in the circle of the
earth; as a proof of which, leaving aside that which experience
shows us, and what you, Timbrio, do, since you have been on
them and have seen, it will suffice to take as an example that
shepherdess whom you see there, oh Timbrio.'</p>

<p>And, saying this, he pointed with his crook to Galatea; and
without saying more, left Timbrio wondering to see the discretion
and words with which he had praised the banks of the
Tagus and Galatea's beauty. And he replied to him that nothing
of what was said could be gainsaid, and in these and other
things they beguiled the tedium of the road, until, coming in
sight of the valley of cypresses, they saw issuing from it almost
as many shepherds and shepherdesses as those who were with
them. All joined together and with peaceful steps began to
enter the sacred valley, the situation of which was so strange
and wondrous that even in the very ones who had seen it many
a time, it caused new admiration and pleasure. On one portion
of the bank of the famous Tagus there rise in four different and
opposite quarters four green and peaceful hills, walls and defenders
as it were of a fair valley which they contain in their midst,
and entrance into it is granted by four other spots. These same
hills close together in such a way that they come to form four
broad and peaceful roads, walled in on all sides by countless
lofty cypresses, set in such order and harmony that even the
very branches of each seem to grow uniformly, and none dares
in the slightest to exceed or go beyond another. The space
there is between cypress and cypress is closed and occupied by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span>
a thousand fragrant rose-bushes and pleasing jessamine, so close
and interwoven as thorny brambles and prickly briars are wont
to be in the hedges of guarded vineyards. From point to point of
these peaceful openings are seen running through the short green
grass clear cool streamlets of pure sweet waters, which have
their birth on the slopes of the same hills. The goal and end of
these roads is a wide round space formed by the declivities and
cypresses, in the midst of which is placed a fountain of cunning
workmanship, built of white and costly marble, made with such
skill and cunning that the beauteous fountains of renowned
Tibur, and the proud ones of ancient Trinacria cannot be compared
to it. With the water of this wondrous fountain are
moistened and sustained the cool grasses of the delightful spot,
and what makes this pleasing situation the more worthy of
esteem and reverence is that it is exempt from the greedy
mouths of simple lambs and gentle sheep, and from any other
kind of flock; for it serves alone as guardian and treasure-house
of the honoured bones of any famous shepherds, who, by the
general decree of all the survivors in the neighbourhood are
determined and ordained to be worthy and deserving of receiving
burial in this famous valley. Therefore there were seen
between the many different trees that were behind the cypresses,
in the space and expanse there was from them to the slopes of
the hills, some tombs, made one of jasper and another of marble,
on the white stones of which one read the names of those who
were buried in them. But the tomb which shone most above all,
and that which showed itself most to the eyes of all, was that of the
famous shepherd Meliso, which, apart from the others, was seen
on one side of the broad space, made of smooth black slates and
of white and well-fashioned alabaster. And at the very moment
the eyes of Telesio beheld it, he turned his face to all that
pleasing company, and said to them with peaceful voice and
piteous tones:</p>

<p>'There you see, gallant shepherds, discreet and fair shepherdesses,
there you see, I say, the sad tomb wherein repose the
honoured bones of the renowned Meliso, honour and glory of
our banks. Begin then to raise to Heaven your humble hearts,
and with pure purpose, copious tears and deep sighs, intone your
holy hymns and devout prayers, and ask Heaven to consent to
receive in its starry abode the blessed soul of the body that lies
there.'</p>

<p>As he said this, he went up to one of the cypresses, and
cutting some branches, he made from them a mournful garland
wherewith he crowned his white and venerable brow, beckoning
to the others to do the same. All, moved by his example, in
one moment crowned themselves with the sad branches, and
guided by Telesio, went up to the tomb, where the first thing
Telesio did was to bend the knee and kiss the hard stone of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span>
tomb. All did the same, and some there were who, made tender
by the memory of Meliso, left the white marble they were kissing
bedewed with tears. This being done, Telesio bade the
sacred fire be kindled, and in a moment around the tomb were
made many, though small, bonfires, in which only branches of
cypress were burned; and the venerable Telesio began with
solemn and peaceful steps to circle the pyre, and to cast into all
the glowing fires a quantity of sacred sweet-smelling incense,
uttering each time he scattered it, some short and devout prayer
for the departed soul of Meliso, at the end of which he would
raise his trembling voice, all the bystanders with sad and piteous
tone replying thrice 'Amen, amen,' to the mournful sound
of which the neighbouring hills and distant valleys re-echoed,
and the branches of the tall cypresses and of the many other
trees of which the valley was full, stricken by a gentle breeze
that blew, made and formed a dull and saddest whisper, almost
as if in token that they for their part shared the sadness of the
funereal sacrifice. Thrice Telesio circled the tomb, and thrice he
uttered the piteous prayers, and nine times more were heard the
mournful tones of the amen which the shepherds repeated.
This ceremony ended, the aged Telesio leaned against a lofty
cypress which rose at the head of Meliso's tomb, and by turning
his face on every side caused the bystanders to attend to what
he wished to say, and straightway raising his voice as much as
the great number of his years could allow, with marvellous
eloquence he began to praise Meliso's virtues, the integrity of
his blameless life, the loftiness of his intellect, the constancy of
his soul, the graceful gravity of his discourse, and the excellence
of his poetry, and above all the solicitude of his breast to keep
and fulfil the holy religion he had professed, joining to these
other virtues of Meliso of such a kind and so great that, though
the shepherd had not been well known by all who were listening
to Telesio, merely by what he was saying, they would have
been inspired to love him, if he had been alive, and to reverence
him after death. The old man then ended his discourse saying:</p>

<p>'If the lowliness of my dull understanding, famous shepherds,
were to attain to where Meliso's excellences attained, and to
where attains the desire I have to praise them, and if the weak
and scanty strength begotten by many weary years did not cut
short my voice and breath, sooner would you see this sun that
illumines us bathing once and again in the mighty ocean, than
I should cease from my discourse begun; but since in my
withered age this is not allowed, do you supply what I lack, and
show yourselves grateful to Meliso's cold ashes, praising them
in death as the love constrains you that he had for you in life.
And though a part of this duty touches and concerns us all in
general, those whom it concerns more particularly are the
famous Thyrsis and Damon, as being so well acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span>
him, such friends, such intimates; and so I beg them, as
urgently as I can, to respond to this obligation, supplying in
song with voice more calm and resounding what I have failed to
do by my tears with my faltering one.'</p>

<p>Telesio said no more, nor indeed had there been need to say
it in order that the shepherds might be moved to do what he
bade them, for straightway, without making any reply, Thyrsis
drew forth his rebeck, and beckoned to Damon to do the same.
They were accompanied straightway by Elicio and Lauso, and all
the shepherds who had instruments there; and in a little while
they made music so sad and pleasing, that though it delighted
the ears, it moved the hearts to give forth tokens of sadness
with the tears the eyes were shedding. To this was joined
the sweet harmony of the little painted birds, that were flitting
through the air, and some sobs that the shepherdesses, already
made tender and moved by Telesio's discourse, and by what the
shepherds were doing, wrung from time to time from their lovely
breasts; and it was of such a kind that the sound of the sad
music and that of the sad harmony of the linnets, larks, and
nightingales, and the bitter sound of the deep groans joining in
unison, all formed together a concert so strange and mournful,
that there is no tongue that could describe it. A little while
after, the other instruments ceasing, only the four of Thyrsis,
Damon, Elicio, and Lauso were heard. These going up to
Meliso's tomb, placed themselves on its four sides, a token from
which all present understood that they were about to sing something.
And so they lent them silence marvellous and subdued,
and straightway the famous Thyrsis, aided by Elicio, Damon,
and Lauso, began, with voice loud, sad and resounding, to sing
in this wise:</p>

<p class="p01">Thyrsis, who had begun the sad and mournful elegy, was the
one who ended it, without any of those that had listened to the
lamentable song ending their tears for a good while. But at
this moment the venerable Telesio said to them:</p>

<p>'Since we have in part, gallant and courteous shepherds,
complied with the debt we owe the blessed Meliso, impose
silence for the nonce on your tender tears, and give some truce
to your grievous sighs, since by neither can we make good the
loss we bewail; and though human sorrow cannot fail to show
sorrow when ill befalls, yet it is necessary to temper the excess
of its attacks with the reason that attends on the discreet. And
although tears and sighs are tokens of the love cherished for
him who is bewailed, the souls for which they are shed gain
more profit by the pious sacrifices and devout prayers which are
offered for them, than if all the ocean main were to be made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
tears and distil through the eyes of all the world. And for this
cause and because we must give some relief to our wearied
bodies, it will be well to leave what remains for us to do till the
coming day, and for the present to make a call on your wallets,
and comply with what nature enjoins on you.'</p>

<p>And in saying this, he gave orders for all the shepherdesses to
abide on one side of the valley near Meliso's tomb, leaving with
them six of the oldest shepherds who were there, and the rest
were in another part a little way from them. And straightway
with what they carried in their wallets and with the water of the
clear spring they satisfied the common necessity of hunger, ending
at a time when already night was clothing with one same colour
all things contained beneath our horizon, and the shining moon
was showing her fair and radiant face in all the fulness she has
when most her ruddy brother imparts to her his rays. But a
little while after, a troubled wind arising, there began to be seen
some black clouds, which in a measure hid the light of the chaste
goddess, making shadows on the earth; tokens from which some
shepherds who were there, masters in rustic astrology, expected
some coming hurricane and tempest. But all ended only in the
night remaining grey and calm, and in their settling down
to rest on the cool grass, yielding their eyes to sweet and peaceful
slumber, as all did save some who shared as sentinels the
guardianship of the shepherdesses, and save the guardian of
some torches that were left blazing round Meliso's tomb. But
now that calm silence prevailed through all that sacred valley,
and now that slothful Morpheus had with his moist branch
touched the brows and eyelids of all those present, at a time when
the wandering stars had gone a good way round our pole,
marking out the punctual courses of the night: at that moment
from the very tomb of Meliso arose a great and wondrous fire,
so bright and shining that in an instant all the dark valley was
in such brightness, as if the very sun had illumined it. By
which sudden marvel the shepherds who were awake near the
tomb, fell astonished to the ground dazzled and blind with the
light of the transparent fire, which produced a contrary effect in
the others who were sleeping; for when they were stricken by
its rays, heavy slumber fled from them, and they opened,
though with some difficulty, their sleeping eyes, and seeing the
strangeness of the light that revealed itself to them, remained
confounded and amazed; and so, one standing, another reclining,
another kneeling, each gazed on the bright fire with amazement
and terror. Telesio seeing all this, arraying himself in a
moment in the sacred vestments, accompanied by Elicio,
Thyrsis, Damon, Lauso, and other spirited shepherds, gradually
began to draw nigh to the fire, with the intention of seeking
with some lawful and fitting exorcisms to extinguish, or to
understand whence came the strange vision which showed itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span>
to them. But when they were drawing nigh to the glowing
flames, they saw them dividing into two parts, and in their
midst appearing a nymph so fair and graceful, that it set them
in greater wonder than the sight of the blazing fire; she
appeared clad in a rich and fine web of silver, gathered and
drawn up at the waist in such wise that half of her legs revealed
themselves arrayed in buskins or close-fitting foot-gear, gilded
and full of countless knots of variegated ribbons. Over the
silver web she wore another vestment of green and delicate silk,
which, wafted from side to side by a light breeze that was gently
blowing, seemed most exquisite. She wore scattered over her
shoulders the longest and the ruddiest locks that human eyes ever
saw, and upon them a garland made of green laurel only. Her
right hand was occupied by a tall branch of the yellow palm of
victory, and her left with another of the green olive of peace.
And with these adornments she showed herself so fair and
wonderful, that all that beheld her she kept rapt by her appearance
in such wise that, casting from them their first fear, they
approached with sure steps the neighbourhood of the fire,
persuading themselves that from so fair a vision no harm could
happen to them. And all being, as has been said, ravished to
see her, the beauteous nymph opened her arms on each side,
and made the divided flames divide the more and part, to give
an opportunity that she might the better be seen; and straightway
raising her calm countenance, with grace and strange
dignity she began words such as these:</p>

<p>'By the results that my unexpected appearance has caused in
your hearts, discreet and pleasing company, you can gather that
it is not by virtue of evil spirits that this form of mine has been
fashioned which presents itself here to you; for one of the
means by which we recognise whether a vision be good or bad,
is by the results it produces on the mind of him who beholds it.
For in the case of the good, though it cause in him wonder and
alarm, such wonder and alarm comes mingled with a pleasant
disturbance which in a little while calms and satisfies him,
contrary to what is caused by the malignant vision, which brings
alarm, discontent, terror, but never assurance. Experience will
make clear to you this truth when you know me, and when I
tell you who I am, and the cause that has moved me to come
from my distant dwelling-place to visit you. And because I do
not wish to keep you in suspense with the desire you have to
know who I am, know, discreet shepherds and beauteous shepherdesses,
that I am one of the nine maidens, who on the lofty
and sacred peaks of Parnassus have their own and famous
abode. My name is Calliope, my duty and disposition it is to
favour and aid the divine spirits, whose laudable practice it is to
busy themselves in the marvellous and never duly lauded science
of poetry. I am she who made the old blind man of Smyrna,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>
famous only through him, win eternal fame; she who will make
the Mantuan Tityrus live for all the ages to come, until time
end; and she who makes the writings, as uncouth as learned, of
the most ancient Ennius, to be esteemed from the past to the
present age. In short, I am she who favoured Catullus, she
who made Horace renowned, Propertius eternal, and I am she
who with immortal fame has preserved the memory of the
renowned Petrarch, and she who made the famous Dante
descend to the dark circles of Hell, and ascend to the bright
spheres of Heaven. I am she who aided the divine Ariosto to
weave the varied and fair web he fashioned; she who in this
country of yours had intimate friendship with the witty Boscan,
and with the famous Garcilaso, with the learned and wise
Castillejo, and the ingenious Torres Naharro, by whose
intellects and by their fruits your country was enriched and I
satisfied. I am she who moved the pen of the celebrated Aldana,
and that which never left the side of Don Fernando de Acuña;
and she who prides herself on the close friendship and converse
she always had with the blessed soul of the body that lies in this
tomb. The funeral rites performed by you in his honour not
only have gladdened his spirit, which now paces through the
eternal realm, but have so satisfied me that I have come perforce
to thank you for so laudable and pious a custom as this is,
which is in use among you. Therefore I promise you, with the
sincerity that can be expected from my virtue, in reward for the
kindness you have shown to the ashes of my dear beloved
Meliso, always to bring it to pass that on your banks there may
never be wanting shepherds to excel all those of the other banks
in the joyous science of poetry. I will likewise always favour
your counsels, and guide your understanding so that you may
never give an unjust vote, when you decide who is deserving of
being buried in this sacred valley; for it will not be right that
an honour, so special and distinguished, and one which is only
deserved by white and tuneful swans, should come to be enjoyed
by black and hoarse crows. And so it seems to me that it will be
right to give you some information now about some distinguished
men who live in this Spain of yours, and about some in the
distant Indies subject to her; and if all or any one of these
should be brought by his good fortune to end the course of his
days on these banks, without any doubt you can grant him
burial in this famous spot. Together with this I wish to warn
you not to think the first I shall name worthy of more honour
than the last, for herein I do not intend to keep any order,
because, though I understand the difference between the one
and the other, and the others among themselves, I wish to leave
the decision of it in doubt, in order that your intellects may have
something to practise on in understanding the difference of
theirs, of which their works will give proof. I shall go through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[Pg 253]</span>
their names as they come to my memory, so that none may
claim that it is a favour I have done him in having remembered
him before another, for, as I tell you, discreet shepherds, I leave
you to give them afterwards the place which seems to you to be
due to them of right; and, in order that with less trouble and
annoyance you may be attentive to my long narration, I will
make it of such a kind that you may only feel displeasure at its
brevity.'</p>

<p>The fair nymph, having said this, was silent and straightway
took a harp she had beside her, which up till that time had been
seen by no one, and, as she began to play it, it seemed that the
sky began to brighten, and that the moon illumined the earth
with new and unwonted splendour; the trees, despite a gentle
breeze that was blowing, held their branches still; and the eyes
of all who were there did not dare to lower their lids, in order
that for the little while they lingered in raising, they might not
be robbed of the glory they enjoyed in beholding the beauty of
the nymph, and indeed all would have wished all their five senses
to be changed into that of hearing only; with such strangeness,
with such sweetness, with so great a charm did the fair muse
play her harp. After she had sounded a few chords, with the
most resounding voice that could be imagined, she began with
verses such as these:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the sweet sound of my harmonious lyre,</span><br />

<p>Scarce had the fair nymph ended the last accents of her
delightful song, when the flames which were divided, uniting
once more, enclosed her in the midst, and straightway, as they
were gradually consumed, the glowing fire in a little while
vanished, and the discreet muse from before the eyes of all, at
a time when already the bright dawn was beginning to reveal
her cool and rosy cheeks over the spacious sky, giving glad
tokens of the coming day. And straightway the venerable
Telesio, setting himself on Meliso's tomb, and surrounded by all
the pleasing company who were there, all lending him a
pleasing attention and strange silence, began to speak to them
in this wise:</p>

<p>'What you have seen this past night in this very spot and
with your eyes, discreet and gallant shepherds, and fair shepherdesses,
will have given you to understand how acceptable to
Heaven is the laudable custom we have of performing these
yearly sacrifices and honourable funeral rites, for the happy
souls of the bodies which by your decree deserved to have
burial in this famous valley. I say this to you, my friends, in
order that henceforth with more fervour and diligence you may
assist in carrying out so holy and famous a work, since you
now see how rare and lofty are the spirits of which the
beauteous Calliope has told us, for all are worthy not only of
your, but of all possible praises. And think not that the
pleasure is small I have felt in learning from so true a narration
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[Pg 289]</span>
how great is the number of the men of divine genius who
live in our Spain to-day; for it always has been and is held by
all foreign nations that the spirits are not many, but few, that
in the science of poetry show that they are of lofty spirit,
the real fact being as different as we see, since each of those
the nymph has named excels the most subtle foreigner, and
they would give clear tokens of it, if poetry were valued as
highly in this Spain of ours as it is in other regions. And so
for this reason the renowned and clear intellects that excel in
it, because of the little esteem in which the princes and the
common people hold them, by their minds alone communicate
their lofty and strange conceptions, without daring to publish
them to the world, and I hold for my part that Heaven must
have ordained it in this way because the world does not
deserve, nor does our heedless age, to enjoy food so pleasant
to the soul. But, since it seems to me, shepherds, that the
little sleep of the past night and our long ceremonies will have
made you somewhat wearied and desirous of repose, it will be
well, after doing the little that remains to us to fulfil our
purpose, for each to return to his hut or to the village, carrying
in his memory what the muse has enjoined on us.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>And, saying this, he descended from the tomb, and crowning
himself once more with new funereal branches, he went again
round the pyre three times, all following him and accompanying
him in some devout prayers he was uttering. This being done,
all having him in their midst, he turned his grave face to
each side, and, bowing his head, and showing a grateful
countenance and eyes full of love, he took leave of all the
company, who, going some by one and some by another side of
the four outlets that place had, in a little while all dispersed and
divided, only those of Aurelio's village remaining, and with
them Timbrio, Silerio, Nisida, and Blanca, with the famous
shepherds, Elicio, Thyrsis, Damon, Lauso, Erastro, Daranio,
Arsindo, and the four hapless ones, Orompo, Marsilio, Crisio,
and Orfenio, with the shepherdesses Galatea, Florisa, Silveria
and her friend Belisa, for whom Marsilio was dying. All
these then being together, the venerable Aurelio told them
that it would be well to depart at once from that place in order
to reach the stream of palms in time to spend the noon-tide
heat there, since it was so suitable a spot for it. What Aurelio
was saying seemed good to all, and straightway they went with
peaceful steps towards where he said. But as the fair appearance
of the shepherdess Belisa would not permit Marsilio's
spirits to rest, he would fain, if he had been able, and it had
been allowed him, have approached her and told her of the
injustice she used towards him; but, not to break through the
respect which was due to Belisa's modesty, the mournful swain
was more silent than his desire required. Love produced the
same effects and symptoms in the souls of the lovers Elicio
and Erastro, who each for himself would fain have told Galatea
what she well knew already. At this moment Aurelio
said:</p>


<p>'It does not seem to me well, shepherds, that you should show
yourselves so greedy as not to be willing to respond to and
repay what you owe to the larks and nightingales and to the
other painted little birds that amongst these trees are delighting
and gladdening you by their untaught wondrous harmony.
Play your instruments and uplift your sounding voices, and
show them that your art and skill in music excel their native
music, and with such a pastime we shall feel less the tedium of
the journey and the rays of the sun which already seem to be
threatening the violence with which they must needs strike the
earth during this noon-tide heat.'</p>

<p>But little was necessary for Aurelio to be obeyed, for straightway
Erastro played his pipe and Arsindo his rebeck, to the
sound of which instruments, all giving the lead to Elicio, he
began to sing in this wise:</p>

Fortune doth deny, and Fate,<br />
Nor is promised by my lot?<br />
Dread of everything have I,<br />
There is naught can give me pleasure,<br />
Yet amidst such agony<br />
Love bestows its chiefest treasure:<br />
<em>More faith in adversity</em>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Victory o'er my grief I gain,</span><br />
Which to such a pass is brought<br />
That it doth Love's height attain,<br />
And I find that from this thought<br />
Comes some solace to my pain;<br />
Although poor and lowly I,<br />
Yet relief so rich in woe<br />
To the fancy I apply,<br />
That the heart may ever know<br />
<em>More faith in adversity</em>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">All the more that every ill</span><br />
Comes with every ill to-day,<br />
And that they my life may fill<br />
With more pain, though deadly they,<br />
They do keep me living still;<br />
But our life in dignity<br />
With a noble end is crowned,<br />
And in mine my fame shall lie,<br />
For in life, in death I found<br/>
<em>More faith in adversity.</em></p>

<p class="p01">Damon's song fully confirmed in Timbrio and in Silerio the
good opinion they had formed of the rare wit of the shepherds
who were there; and the more when, at the persuasion of
Thyrsis and of Elicio, the now free and disdainful Lauso, to the
sound of Arsindo's flute, released his voice in verses such as
these:</p>



<p class="p01">L<small>AUSO.</small></p>

Hath restored the liberty<br />
Born from absence of thy pains;<br />

And as best he thinketh, seek<br />
To convert me to his views.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">I my love did soon forsake,</span><br />

By a hair so finely strung<br />
That it e'en a breath could break;<br />
All the plaints Love did provoke,<br />
All my sighs, did feignèd prove,<br />
Nay the very shafts of Love<br />
Did not pierce beneath my cloke.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">For no torture 'tis for me</span><br />
To be callèd fickle, vain,<br />
If I may behold again<br />
My neck from the mad yoke free;<br />
Who Silena is, I know,<br />
And how strange her mood hath been,<br />
How her peaceful face serene<br />
Promise and deceit doth show.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">To her wondrous dignity,</span><br />
To her fair and downcast eyes,<br />
'Tis not much to yield the prize<br />
Of the will, whose'er it be,<br />

Now we know her, fain would we<br />
Life and more, if more could be,<br />
Give to see her nevermore.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ofttimes to her have I given</span><br />
Heaven's Silena and my dear<br />
For her name&mdash;she was so fair<br />
That she seemed the child of Heaven;<br />
Better now her name shall be&mdash;<br />
Now that I need fear no more&mdash;<br />
Not Silena, Heaven's flower,<br />
But false Siren of the sea.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Earnest words, frivolities,</span><br />
Gazing eyes and ardent pen<br />
Of the lover, blind and vain,&mdash;<br />
Take a countless sum of these,<br />
And the last is ever first;<br />
Whoso hath in love surpassed,<br />
As the first loved, e'en at last<br />
Is by her disdain accursed.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">How much fairer would we deem</span><br />
Our Silena's beauteous grace,<br />
If her wisdom and her ways<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[Pg 297]</span>Did her fairness but beseem!<br />
She discretion hath at will,<br />
But a halter 'tis to slay<br />
The presumption of her way,<br />
For she useth it so ill.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">I speak not with shameless tongue,</span><br />
For it were but passion wild,<br />
But I speak as one beguiled,<br />
Who hath suffered grievous wrong;<br />
Passion doth no more me blind,<br />
Nor desire that she should wrong<br />
Suffer, for always my tongue<br />
Was in reason's bonds confined.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her caprices manifold,</span><br />
And her moods that ever change,<br />
From her every hour estrange<br />
Those who were her friends of old;<br />
Since Silena foes hath made<br />
In the many ways we see,<br />
Wholly good she cannot be,<br />
Or they must be wholly bad.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">Lauso ended his song, and though he thought that no one
understood him, through ignorance of Silena's disguised name,
more than three of those who were there knew her, and even
marvelled that Lauso's modest behaviour should have gone so
far as to attack anyone, especially the disguised shepherdess
with whom they had seen him so much in love. But in the
opinion of his friend Damon he was fully excused, for he was
acquainted with Silena's conduct, and knew how she had conducted
herself towards Lauso, and wondered at what he left
unsaid. Lauso finished, as has been said; and as Galatea had
heard of the charm of Nisida's voice, she wished to sing first,
so as to constrain her to do the same. And for this reason, before
any other shepherd could begin, beckoning to Arsindo to continue
sounding his flute, to its sound with her exquisite voice
she sang in this wise:</p>


<p class="p01">G<small>ALATEA.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"> E'en as Love ever seeks the soul to entame,</span><br />
Tempting it by the semblance of delight,<br />
E'en so she from Love's deadly pangs in flight<br />
Turneth, who knows its name bestowed by fame.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The breast that doth oppose his amorous flame,</span><br />
The breast with honourable resistance armed,<br />
By Love's unkindness is but little harmed,<br />
Little his fire and rigour doth inflame.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Secure is she who never was beloved,</span><br />
Nor could love, from that tongue which in dispraise<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[Pg 298]</span>
Of her honour, with subtle glow doth gleam.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But if to love and not to love have proved</span><br />
Fruitful in harm, how shall she spend her days<br />
Who honour dearer e'en than life doth deem?</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">It could easily be seen in Galatea's song that she was
replying to Lauso's malicious one, and that she was not against
unfettered wills, but against the malicious tongues and wronged
souls which, in not gaining what they desire, change the love
they once showed to a malicious and detestable hatred, as she
fancied in Lauso's case; but perhaps she would have escaped
from this error, if she had known Lauso's good disposition, and
had not been ignorant of Silena's evil one. As soon as Galatea
ceased to sing, she begged Nisida with courteous words to do
the same. She, as she was as courteous as beautiful, without
letting herself be pressed, to the sound of Florisa's pipe sang in
this fashion:</p>

<p class="p01">N<small>ISIDA</small>.</p>
<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bravely I took my courage as defence</span><br />
In the dread conflict and onslaught of Love,<br />
My boldness bravely raised to Heaven above<br />
Against the rigour of the clear offence.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But yet so overwhelming and intense</span><br />
The battery, and withal so weak my power<br />
That, though Love seized me not, in one short hour<br />
Love brought me to confess his power immense.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er worth, o'er honour, o'er a mind discreet,</span><br />
Shy modesty, a bosom of disdain,<br />
Love doth with ease achieve the victory;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherefore, in order to escape defeat,</span><br />
Strength from no words of wisdom can we gain,<br />
Unto this truth an eye-witness am I.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">When Nisida ceased to sing and to fill with admiration
Galatea and those who had been listening to her, they were
already quite near the spot where they had determined to pass
the noon-tide hour. But in that short time Belisa had time to
fulfil Silveria's request, which was that she should sing something;
and she, accompanied by the sound of Arsindo's flute,
sang what follows:</p>

<p class="p01">B<small>ELISA.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw15">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fancy, that is fancy-free,</span><br />
Listen to the reason why<br />
Our fame groweth steadily,<br />
Pass the vain affection by,<br />
Mother of all injury;<br />
For whene'er the soul doth load<br />
Itself with some loving load,<br />
Bane that takes the life away,<br />
Mixed with juice of bitter bay,<br />
Is to it but pleasing food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">But our precious liberty</span><br />
Should not bartered be nor sold<br />
For the greatest quantity<br />
Of the best refinèd gold,<br />
Best in worth and quality;<br />
Shall we bring ourselves to bear<br />
Such a loss and heed the prayer<br />
Of a lover whom we scorn,<br />
If all blessings ever born<br />
Do not with such bliss compare?</p>


<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">If the grief we cannot bear</span><br />
When the body, free from love,<br />
Is confined in prison drear,<br />
Shall the pain not greater prove,<br />
When the very soul is there?<br />
Pain 'twill be of such a kind<br />
That no remedy we find<br />
For such ill in patience, time,<br />
Worth, or learning in its prime,<br />
Naught save death alone is kind.</p>


<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wherefore let my healthy mood</span><br />
From this madness flee away,<br />
Leave behind so false a good,<br />
Let my free will ever sway<br />
Every fancy as it would;<br />
Let my tender neck and free<br />
Never yield itself to be<br />
Placed beneath the loving yoke,<br />
Whereby peace is, at a stroke,<br />
Slain, and banished liberty.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">The shepherdess's verses of freedom reached the soul of the
hapless Marsilio, by reason of the little hope her words held
out that her deeds would grow better; but as the faith with
which he loved her was so firm, the noteworthy proofs of
freedom he had heard uttered, could not but keep him as much
without it as he had been before. At this point the road leading
to the stream of palms ended, and though they had not had the
intention of spending the noon-tide heat there, when they
reached it and saw the comfort of the beautiful spot, it would
have of itself compelled them not to go further. When they
had come to it then, straightway the venerable Aurelio commanded
all to seat themselves beside the clear and glassy
stream, which was flowing in amongst the short grass, and had
its birth at the foot of a very tall and ancient palm (for there
being on all the banks of the Tagus only that one, and another
which was beside it, that place and stream was called "of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[Pg 300]</span>
palms"), and after sitting down, they were served by Aurelio's
shepherds with more good-will and simplicity than costly
victuals, satisfying their thirst with the clear cool waters that the
pure stream offered them. And on ending the short and pleasant
repast, some of the shepherds separated and departed to seek
some shady place apart, where they might make up for the
unslept hours of the past night; and there remained alone only
those of Aurelio's company and village with Timbrio, Silerio,
Nisida and Blanca, Thyrsis and Damon, to whom it appeared
to be better to enjoy the fair converse that was expected there,
than any other enjoyment that sleep could offer them. Aurelio
then, guessing and almost knowing this their purpose, said to
them:</p>

<p>'It will be well, sirs, that we, who are here, since we have not
wished to yield ourselves to sweet sleep, should not fail to
make use of this time we steal from it in something that may
be more to our pleasure, and what, it seems to me, will not fail
to give it us, is that each, as best he can, should here show the
sharpness of his wits, propounding some question, or riddle, to
whom the companion who may be at his side may be forced to
reply; since with this pastime two things will be gained&mdash;one
to spend with less tedium the hours we shall be here, the other,
not to weary our ears so much with always hearing lamentations
of love, and love-sick dirges.'</p>

<p>All straightway fell in with Aurelio's wish, and without any
of them leaving the place where they were, the first who began
to question was Aurelio himself, speaking in this wise:</p>

<p class="p01">A<small>URELIO.</small></p>

</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">The answering of this question fell to the old shepherd
Arsindo, who was beside Aurelio; and having for a little while
considered what it could denote, at last he said to him:</p>

<p>'It seems to me, Aurelio, that our age compels us to be more
enamoured of that which your question denotes than of the
most graceful shepherdess that might present herself to us, for,
if I am not mistaken, the mighty and renowned one you mention
is wine, and all the attributes you have given him tally
with it.'</p>

<p>'You speak truth, Arsindo,' replied Aurelio, 'and I am
inclined to say that I am sorry to have propounded a question
which has been solved with much ease; but do you tell yours,
for at your side you have one who will be able to unravel it for
you, however knotty it may be.'</p>

<p>'I agree,' said Arsindo; and straightway he propounded the
following:</p>

<p class="p01">A<small>RSINDO.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw15">

In a moment doth revive<br />
And his colour takes anew?<br />

Afterwards black as a crow,<br />
Last, so ruddy is his glow<br />

<p class="p01">It was Damon who was at Arsindo's side, and scarcely had
the latter finished his question, when he said to him:</p>

<p>'It seems to me, Arsindo, that your query is not so dark as
the thing it denotes, for if I am not wrong in it, it is charcoal of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span>

you are in the same plight as Aurelio, by reason of the ease with
which your question has been understood, I am going to keep
you company in it, since Thyrsis, to whom it falls to answer
me, will make us equal.'</p>

<p>And straightway he spoke his:</p>

<p class="p01">D<small>AMON.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">

And it is a certain thing<br />
That amongst them is the king,<br />
And with all men they are found.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">'Verily, friend Damon,' said Thyrsis forthwith, 'your challenge
comes true, and you pay the forfeit that Aurelio and Arsindo
pay, if any there be; for I tell you I know that what your
riddle conceals is a letter,<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and a pack of cards.'</p>

<p>Damon admitted that Thyrsis was right. And straightway
Thyrsis propounded his riddle thus:</p>

<p class="p01">T<small>HYRSIS.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw15">

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who is she that is all eyes,</span><br />

Evil worketh, and doth fire<br />
Love, and to love brings relief.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">Thyrsis's riddle puzzled Elicio, for it was his turn to answer it,
and he was on the point of 'giving up,' as the saying is; but in
a little while he managed to say that it was jealousy, and,
Thyrsis admitting it, Elicio straightway propounded the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[Pg 303]</span></p>


<p class="p01">E<small>LICIO.</small></p>

<p class="p01">Timbrio could not hit upon the thing which Elicio's question
denoted, and he almost began to be ashamed at seeing that he
delayed longer in answering than any one else, but not even
this consideration made him come to a better perception of it;
and he delayed so long that Galatea, who was after Nisida,
said:</p>

<p>'If it is allowed to break the order which is given, and the
one who should first know may reply, I say for my part that I
know what the riddle propounded denotes, and I am ready to
solve it, if señor Timbrio gives me leave.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, fair Galatea,' replied Timbrio, 'for I know that
just as I lack, so you have a superabundance of, wit, to solve
greater difficulties; but nevertheless I wish you to be patient
until Elicio repeats it, and if this time I do not hit it, the opinion
I have of my wit and yours, will be confirmed with more truth.'</p>

<p>Elicio repeated his question, and straightway Timbrio solved
its meaning, saying:</p>

<p>'With the very thing by which I thought your query was
obscured, Elicio, it appears to me to be solved, for the last line
says, that they are to say what is this thing so pretty. And
so I answer you in what you ask me, and say that your question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[Pg 304]</span>
means that which we mean by a pretty thing;<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and do not be
surprised that I have been long in answering, for, if I had
answered sooner, I would have been more surprised at my wit;
which will show what it is in the small skill of my question,
which is this:</p>

<p class="p01">T<small>IMBRIO.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who is he who to his pain</span><br />

Doth by no means ease his woe,<br />
But achieveth more displeasure.'</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">It fell to Nisida to reply to Timbrio's question, but neither
she nor Galatea who followed her were able to guess it. And
Orompo, seeing that the shepherdesses were wearying themselves
in thinking what it denoted, said to them:</p>

<p>'Do not tire yourselves, ladies, nor weary your minds in
solving this riddle, for it might well be that neither of you in
all her life has seen the figure that the question conceals, and
so it is no wonder that you should not hit upon it; for if it
had been of a different kind, we were quite sure, as regards
your minds, that in a shorter time you would have solved others
more difficult. And therefore, with your leave, I am going to
reply to Timbrio, and tell him that his query denotes a man in
fetters, since when he draws his feet from those eyes he speaks
of, it is either to set him free or to take him to execution; so
that you may see, shepherdesses, if I was right in thinking that
perhaps neither of you had seen in all her life jails or prisons.'</p>

<p>'I for my part can say,' said Galatea, 'that never have I seen
any one imprisoned.'</p>

<p>Nisida and Blanca said the same. And straightway Nisida
propounded her question in this form:</p>

<p class="p01">N<small>ISIDA.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fire it biteth, and its bite</span><br />

But if deep should be the wound,<br />

Death comes to the victim poor,<br />
In such death its life is found.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">Galatea delayed little in answering Nisida, for straightway
she said to her:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[Pg 305]</span></p>
<p>'I am quite sure that I am not mistaken, fair Nisida, if I say
that your riddle can in no way be better applied than to candle-snuffers
and to the taper or candle they snuff; and if this is
true, as it is, and you are satisfied with my reply, listen now to
mine, which I hope will be solved by your sister with no less
ease than I have done yours.'</p>

<p>And straightway she spoke it, and it ran thus:</p>

<div class="p01">G<small>ALATEA.</small></div>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"> Children three, who love inspire,</span><br />

That they gave her countless blows,<br />
Showing thus their skilfulness.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">Blanca was considering what Galatea's riddle could denote,
when they saw two gallant shepherds crossing at a run near the
place where they were, showing by the fury with which they
were running that something important constrained them to
move their steps with such speed, and straightway at the same
moment they heard some mournful cries, as of persons seeking
help; and on this alarm all arose and followed the direction whence
the cries sounded; and in a few steps they issued from that
delightful spot and came out on the bank of the cool Tagus,
which, close at hand, was flowing gently by. And scarcely did
they see the river, when the strangest thing they could imagine
was presented to their gaze; for they saw two shepherdesses
seemingly of noble grace, who were holding a shepherd fast by
the lappets of his coat with all the strength in their power, in
order that the poor fellow might not drown himself, for he
already had half his body in the river, and his head below the
water, struggling with his feet to release himself from the
shepherdesses, who were hindering his desperate purpose.
They were already almost on the point of letting him go, being
unable to overcome his obstinate determination with their feeble
strength. But at this point the two shepherds approached, who
had been coming at a run, and seizing the desperate man,
drew him out of the water just as all the others were already
approaching, astounded at the strange sight, and they were
more so, when they learned that the shepherd who wished to
drown himself was Artidoro's brother, Galercio, while the
shepherdesses were his sister Maurisa and the fair Teolinda;
and when these saw Galatea and Florisa, Teolinda ran with
tears in her eyes to embrace Galatea, saying:</p>

<p>'Ah, Galatea, sweet friend and lady mine, how has this luckless
wretch fulfilled the word she gave you to return to see you
and tell you the news of her happiness!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>'I shall be as glad for you to have it, Teolinda,' replied
Galatea, 'as you are assured by the good-will you know I
have to serve you; but it seems to me that your eyes do not
bear out your words, nor indeed do these satisfy me so as to
make me imagine a successful issue to your desires.'</p>

<p>Whilst Galatea was thus occupied with Teolinda, Elicio and
Artidoro with the other shepherds had stripped Galercio, and as
they loosened his coat, which with all his clothes had been
wetted, a paper fell from his bosom, which Thyrsis picked up,
and, opening it, saw that it was verse; and not being able to
read it because it was wet, he placed it on a lofty branch in the
sun's ray so that it might dry. On Galercio they placed a cloak
of Arsindo's, and the luckless youth was as it were astounded
and amazed, without saying a word, though Elicio asked him
what was the cause that had brought him to so strange a pass.
But his sister Maurisa answered for him, saying:</p>

<p>'Raise your eyes, shepherds, and you will see who is the
cause that has set my unfortunate wretch of a brother in so
strange and desperate a plight.'</p>

<p>The shepherds raised their eyes at what Maurisa said, and
saw a graceful and comely shepherdess on a beetling rock that
overhung the river, seated on the same crag, and watching with
smiling countenance all that the shepherds were doing. She
was straightway recognised by all as the cruel Gelasia.</p>

<p>'That loveless, that thankless girl, sirs,' went on Maurisa, 'is
the mortal enemy of this my unhappy brother, who, as all these
banks already know and you are not unaware, loves her, worships
her and adores her; and in return for the ceaseless services he
has always done her, and for the tears that he has shed for her,
she this morning, with the most scornful and loveless disdain
that could ever be found in cruelty, bade him go from her
presence, and never return to her now or henceforth. And my
brother wished to obey her so earnestly, that he sought to take
away his life, to avoid the occasion of ever transgressing her
bidding; and if these shepherds had not by chance come so
quickly, the end of my happiness, and the end of my hapless
brother's days would by now have come.'</p>

<p>What Maurisa said set all those who listened to her in amazement,
and they were more amazed when they saw that the cruel
Gelasia, without moving from the spot where she was, and
without taking account of all that company who had their eyes
set on her, with a strange grace and spirited disdain, drew a
small rebeck from her wallet, and stopping to tune it very
leisurely, after a little while with a voice of great beauty began
to sing in this wise:</p>

<p class="p01">G<small>ELASIA.</small></p>

<p class="p01">Gelasia was singing, and showing in the motion and expression
of her face her loveless disposition; but scarcely had she
come to the last verse of her song, when she rose with a strange
swiftness, and, as if she were fleeing from some terrible thing,
she began to hurry down by the crag, leaving the shepherds
amazed at her disposition and astounded at her swift course.
But straightway they saw what was the cause of it, on seeing
the enamoured Lenio, who with dragging step was ascending
the same crag, with the intention of coming to where Gelasia
was; but she was not willing to wait for him, so as not to fail
in a single instance to act in accordance with the cruelty of her
purpose. The wearied Lenio came to the summit of the crag,
when Gelasia was already at its foot, and seeing that she did
not check her steps, but directed them with more haste through
the spacious plain, with spent breath and tired spirit he sat
down in the same spot where Gelasia had been, and there
began with desperate words to curse his fortune, and the hour
in which he raised his eyes to gaze on the cruel shepherdess
Gelasia, and in that same moment, repenting as it were of what
he was saying, he turned to bless his eyes, and to extol the
cause that placed him in such a pass. And straightway goaded
and urged by a fit of frenzy, he flung his crook far from him,
and, stripping off his coat, cast it into the waters of the clear
Tagus, which followed close by the foot of the crag. And
when the shepherds who were watching him saw this, they
believed without a doubt that the violence of his love-passion
was depriving him of reason; and so Elicio and Erastro began
to ascend the crag to prevent him from doing any other mad
act, that might cost him more dear. And though Lenio saw
them ascending, he made no other movement save to draw his
rebeck from a wallet, and with a new and strange calm sat
down again; and turning his face to where his shepherdess
heard, he began with a voice mellow and accompanied with
tears to sing in this fashion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span></p>

Harder than marble to my agony!</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p01">While the hapless shepherd was intoning his piteous plaints,
the other shepherds were reproving Galercio for his evil design,
condemning the wicked purpose he had displayed. But the
despairing youth replied to nothing, whereat Maurisa was not
a little distressed, believing that, if left alone, he must carry out
his evil thought. In the meantime Galatea and Florisa, going
aside with Teolinda, asked her what was the cause of her return,
and if by chance she had already heard of her Artidoro. To
which she replied weeping:</p>

<p>'I know not what to say to you, friends and ladies mine, save
that Heaven wished that I should find Artidoro, to lose him
utterly; for you must know that that same unconsiderate and
traitorous sister of mine, who was the beginning of my misfortune,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[Pg 309]</span>
has been the cause of the end and termination of my happiness.
For learning, as we came with Galercio and Maurisa to their
village, that Artidoro was on a mountain not far from there with
his flock, she went away to look for him without telling me
anything. She found him, and, pretending that she was I (since
for this wrong alone Heaven ordained that we should be alike),
with little difficulty gave him to understand that the shepherdess
who had disdained him in our village was a sister of hers, who
was exceedingly like her; in a word, she recounted to him, as
though they were hers, all the actions I have done for his sake,
and the extremes of grief I have suffered. And as the heart of
the shepherd was so tender and loving, with far less than the
traitress told him would she have been believed by him, as
indeed he did believe her, so much to my hurt, that without
waiting for fortune to mingle any new obstacle with his pleasure,
straightway at the very moment he gave his hand to Leonarda,
to be her lawful husband, believing he was giving it to Teolinda.
Here you see, shepherdesses, where the fruit of my tears and
sighs has ended; here you see all my hope already torn up by
the root; and what I feel most is that it has been by the hand
that was most bound to sustain it. Leonarda enjoys Artidoro
by means of the false deception I have told you, and although
he already knows it, though he must have perceived the trick,
he has kept it to himself like a wise man. The tidings of his
marriage came straightway to the village, and with them those
of the end of my happiness; the stratagem of my sister was
also known, who gave as excuse that she saw Galercio, whom
she loved so much, going to ruin through the shepherdess
Gelasia, and that therefore it seemed to her easier to bring to
her will the loving will of Artidoro than Galercio's despairing
one, and that since the two were but one as regards outward
appearance and nobility, she counted herself happy and fortunate,
indeed, with Artidoro's companionship. With this the enemy
of my bliss excuses herself, as I have said; and so I, not to see
her enjoy that which was rightly due to me, left the village and
Artidoro's presence, and accompanied by the saddest fancies
that can be fancied, came to give you the news of my misery in
the company of Maurisa, who likewise comes with the intention
of telling you what Grisaldo has done since he learnt Rosaura's
abduction. And this morning at sunrise we fell in with Galercio,
who with tender and loving words was urging Gelasia to love
him well; but she with the strongest disdain and scorn that can
be told, bade him leave her presence, nor dare ever to speak to
her. And the hapless shepherd, crushed by so harsh a bidding,
and by cruelty so strange, wished to fulfil it, doing what you
have seen. All this is what has happened to me, my friends,
since I went from your presence. Think now whether I have
more to weep for than before, and whether the cause has grown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span>
for you to busy yourselves in consoling me, if perchance my woe
might admit of consolation.'</p>

<p>Teolinda said no more, for the countless tears that came to
her eyes, and the sighs she wrung from her soul, hindered her
tongue in its office; and though the tongues of Galatea and
Florisa wished to show themselves skilful and eloquent in
consoling her, their toil was of little avail. And while this
converse was passing between the shepherdesses, the paper
which Thyrsis had taken from Galercio's bosom became dry,
and being anxious to read it he took it and saw that it ran
thus:</p>

<p class="p01">Galercio's verses seemed better to Thyrsis than Gelasia's
disposition, and wishing to show them to Elicio, he saw him so
changed in hue and countenance that he seemed the image of
death. He went up to him, and when he wished to ask him if
any grief were distressing him, there was no need to await his
reply in order to learn the cause of his pain, for straightway he
heard it announced amongst all those who were there. Now
the two shepherds who helped Galercio, were friends of the
Lusitanian shepherd to whom the venerable Aurelio had agreed
to marry Galatea, and they were coming to tell him how the
fortunate shepherd would come in three days' time to his village
to conclude that most happy betrothal. And straightway
Thyrsis saw that this news must needs cause in Elicio's soul
newer and stranger symptoms than had been caused; but
nevertheless he went up to him and said to him:</p>

<p>'Now it is necessary, good friend, that you should know how
to make use of the discretion you have, since in the greatest
peril hearts show themselves courageous, and I assure you that
there is something assures me that this business must have a
better end than you think. Dissemble and be silent, for if
Galatea's will takes no pleasure in conforming wholly with her
father's, you will satisfy yours, by availing yourself of ours, and
also of all the favour that can be offered you by all the shepherds
there are on the banks of this river, and on those of the gentle
Henares. And this favour I offer you, for I feel quite sure that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[Pg 313]</span>
the desire all know I have to serve them, will constrain them to
act so that what I promise you here may not turn out vain.'</p>

<p>Elicio remained amazed, seeing the generous and true offer
of Thyrsis, and could not nor did he know how to reply to him
save by embracing him closely and saying to him:</p>

<p>'May Heaven reward you, discreet Thyrsis, for the consolation
you have given me, by which and by Galatea's will, which,
as I think, will not differ from ours, I understand without doubt
that so notorious a wrong as is being done to all these banks in
banishing from them the rare beauty of Galatea, shall not go
further.'</p>

<p>And, as he turned to embrace him, the lost colour returned to
his face. But it did not return to Galatea's, to whom hearing
of the shepherds' embassy was as if she heard her death-sentence.
Elicio noted it all, and Erastro could not ignore it,
nor yet the discreet Florisa, nor indeed was the news pleasing
to any of those who were there. At this hour the sun was
already descending by his wonted course, and therefore for this
reason, as well as because they saw that the love-sick Lenio
had followed Gelasia, and there was nothing else left to do
there, all that company, taking Galercio and Maurisa with them,
bent their steps towards the village, and on coming close to it,
Elicio and Erastro remained in their huts, and with them
remained Thyrsis, Damon, Orompo, Crisio, Marsilio, Arsindo
and Orfenio, with some other shepherds. The fortunate
Timbrio, Silerio, Nisida, and Blanca took leave of them all with
courteous words and offers, telling them that on the morrow
they intended to set out for the city of Toledo, where the end of
their journey was to be; and embracing all who were remaining
with Elicio, they departed with Aurelio, with whom went
Florisa, Teolinda and Maurisa, and the sad Galatea, so heart-broken
and thoughtful that with all her discretion she could not
fail to give tokens of strange unhappiness. With Daranio
departed his wife Silveria and the fair Belisa. Thereon the
night closed in, and it seemed to Elicio that all the roads to his
pleasure were closed with it, and had it not been for welcoming
with cheerful mien the guests he had in his hut that night, he
would have spent it so badly that he would have despaired of
seeing the day. The wretched Erastro was passing through
the same trouble, though with more relief, for, without regarding
anyone, with loud cries and piteous words he cursed his fortune
and Aurelio's hasty resolve. This being so, when the shepherds
had satisfied their hunger with some rustic victuals, and some
of them had yielded themselves to the arms of peaceful sleep,
the fair Maurisa came to Elicio's hut, and finding Elicio at the
door of his hut, took him aside and gave him a paper, telling
him it was from Galatea, and that he should read it at once,
for, since she was bringing it at such an hour, he should under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[Pg 314]</span>stand
that what it must contain was important. The shepherd,
wondering at Maurisa's coming, and more at seeing in his
hands a paper from his shepherdess, could not rest for a
moment until he read it, and entering his hut, read it by the
light of a splinter of resinous pine, and saw that it read thus:</p>


<p class="p1 center">G<small>ALATEA TO</small> E<small>LICIO.</small></p>

<p>'In my father's hasty resolve lies the resolve I have taken to
write to you, and in the violence he uses towards me lies the
violence I have used towards myself to reach this extreme.
You well know in what an extreme pass I am, and I know well
that I would gladly see myself in a better, that I might reward
you somewhat for the much I know I owe you. But if Heaven
wishes me to remain in this debt, complain of it, and not of my
will. My father's I would gladly change, if it were possible,
but I see that it is not, and so I do not try it. If you think of
any remedy in that quarter, so long as prayers have no part in
it, put it into effect with the consideration you owe to your
reputation and hold due to my honour. He whom they are
giving me as husband, he who shall give me burial, is coming
the day after to-morrow; little time remains for you to take
counsel, though sufficient remains to me for repentance. I say
no more save that Maurisa is faithful and I unhappy.'</p>


<p>The words of Galatea's letter set Elicio in strange confusion,
as it seemed to him a new thing both that she should write to
him, since up till then she had never done so, and that she
should bid him seek a remedy for the wrong that was being
done her. But, passing over all these things, he paused only to
think how he should fulfil what was bidden him, though he
should hazard therein a thousand lives, if he had so many.
And as no other remedy offered itself to him save that which
he was awaiting from his friends, he made bold, trusting in
them, to reply to Galatea by a letter he gave to Maurisa, which
ran in this manner:</p>


<div class="p1 center">E<small>LICIO TO</small> G<small>ALATEA.</small></div>

<p>'If the violence of my strength came up to the desire I have
to serve you, fair Galatea, neither that which your father uses
towards you, nor the greatest in the world, would have power
to injure you. But, be that as it may, you will see now, if the
wrong goes further, that I do not lag behind in doing your
bidding in the best way the case may demand. Let the faithfulness
you have known in me, assure you of this, and show a
good face to present fortune, trusting in coming prosperity,
for Heaven which has moved you to remember me and write
to me, will give me strength to show that I merit in part the
favour you have done me, for, if only it be obeying you, neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[Pg 315]</span>
fear nor dread will have power to prevent me putting into effect
what befits your happiness, and is of such import to mine. No
more, for what more there is to be in this, you will learn from
Maurisa, to whom I have given account of it; and if your
opinion does not agree with mine, let me be informed, in order
that time may not pass by, and with it the season of our
happiness, which may Heaven give you as it can and as your
worth deserves.'</p>

<p>Having given this letter to Maurisa, as has been said, he
told her also how he was intending to assemble as many
shepherds as he could, and that all should go together to speak
to Galatea's father, asking him as a signal favour to be so kind
as not to banish from those meadows her peerless beauty; and,
should this not suffice, he was intending to place such obstacles
and terrors before the Lusitanian shepherd that he himself
would say that he was not content with what had been agreed;
and, should prayers and stratagems be of no avail, he was
resolved to use violence and thereby set her at liberty, and that
with the consideration for her reputation which could be
expected from one who loved her so much. With this resolve
Maurisa went away, and the same was taken straightway by all
the shepherds that were with Elicio, for he gave to them
account of his intentions, asking for favour and counsel in so
difficult a plight. Straightway Thyrsis and Damon offered to
be those who should speak to Galatea's father. Lauso, Arsindo,
and Erastro, with the four friends, Orompo, Marsilio, Crisio
and Orfenio, promised to look for their friends and assemble
them for the following day, and to carry out with them whatsoever
should be bidden them by Elicio. In discussing what was
best suited to the case, and in taking this resolve, the greater
part of that night passed away. And, the morning having
come, all the shepherds departed to fulfil what they had
promised, save Thyrsis and Damon, who remained with Elicio.
And that same day Maurisa came again to tell Elicio how
Galatea was resolved to follow his opinion in everything; Elicio
took leave of her with new promises and confidences; and with
joyous countenance and strange gaiety he was awaiting the
coming day to see the good or evil issue fortune was bestowing
on his work. With this night came on, and, Elicio repairing
with Damon and Thyrsis to his hut, they spent almost all of it
in testing and taking note of all the difficulties that could arise
in that affair, if perchance Aurelio was not moved by the
arguments Thyrsis intended to bring before him. But Elicio,
in order to give the shepherds opportunity for repose, went out
of his hut, and ascended a green hill that rose before it; and
there, girt round with solitude, he was revolving in his memory
all that he had suffered for Galatea, and what he feared he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[Pg 316]</span>
would suffer, if Heaven did not favour his plans. And without
leaving this train of thought, to the sound of a soft breeze that
was gently blowing, with a voice sweet and low he began to
sing in this wise:</p>

<p class="p01">E<small>LICIO.</small></p>
<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">If 'midst this boiling sea and gulf profound</span><br />
Of madness, 'midst the tempest's threatening strife,<br />
I from so cruel a blow rescue my life,<br />
And reach the haven, fortunate and sound,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each hand uplifted to the air around,</span><br />
With humble soul and will contented, I<br />
Shall make Love know my thanks, and Heaven on high,<br />
For the choice bliss wherewith my life is crowned.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then fortunate shall I my sighings call,</span><br />
My tears shall I account as full of pleasure,<br />
The flame wherein I burn, refreshing cold.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Love's wounds, I shall declare, are to the soul</span><br />
Sweet, to the body wholesome, that no measure<br />
Can mete his bliss, which boundless I behold.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p01">When Elicio ended his song, the cool dawn, with her fair
cheeks of many hues, was beginning to reveal herself by the
Eastern gates, gladdening the earth, sprinkling the grass with
pearls, and painting the meadows; whose longed-for approach
the chattering birds straightway began to greet with thousand
kinds of harmonious songs. Thereon Elicio arose and, stretching
his eyes over the spacious plain, discovered not far away
two troops of shepherds, who, as it seemed to him, were making
their way towards his hut, as was the truth, for he straightway
recognised that they were his friends Lauso and Arsindo with
others whom they were bringing with them. And the others
were Orompo, Marsilio, Crisio and Orfenio, with as many of
their friends as they could assemble. Elicio then recognising
them, descended from the hill to go and welcome them; and
when they came near to the hut, Thyrsis and Damon, who were
going to look for Elicio, were already outside it. In the meantime
all the shepherds came up and welcomed each other with
joyous countenance. And straightway Lauso, turning to Elicio,
said to him:</p>

<p>'In the company we bring, you can see, friend Elicio, whether
we are beginning to give tokens of our wish to fulfil the word
we gave you; all whom you see here, come with the desire to
serve you, though they should hazard their lives therein. What
is wanting is that you should not be wanting in what may be
most essential.'</p>

<p>Elicio, with the best words he could, thanked Lauso and the
others for the favour they were doing him, and straightway told
them all that it had been agreed with Thyrsis and Damon to
do in order to succeed in that enterprise. What Elicio was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[Pg 317]</span>
saying seemed good to the shepherds; and so, without more
delay, they made their way towards the village, Thyrsis and
Damon going in front, and all the others following them, who
might be some twenty shepherds, the bravest and most graceful
that could be found on all the banks of the Tagus, and all were
minded, if the reasonings of Thyrsis did not move Aurelio to
act reasonably in what they asked him, to use force instead of
reason, nor to consent that Galatea should yield herself to the
foreign shepherd; whereat Erastro was as happy, as if a fair
issue to that demand were to redound to his happiness alone,
for, rather than lose sight of Galatea, absent and unhappy, he
held it a good bargain that Elicio should win her, as he thought
he would, since Galatea must needs be so much indebted to
him.</p>

<p>The end of this loving tale and history, with what happened
to Galercio, Lenio and Gelasia, Arsindo, Maurisa, Grisaldo,
Artandro and Rosaura, Marsilio and Belisa, with other things
which happened to the shepherds mentioned hitherto, is
promised in the Second Part of this history. Which, if it
sees this First received with favourable wishes, will have the
boldness shortly to come out in order to be seen and judged
by the eyes and understanding of mankind.</p>

<p>[The following brief notes, based on Barrera's commentary, and corrected or
supplemented in the light of subsequent research, have been drawn up in the hope
that they may be of use to the general reader. In a certain number of cases it
has, unfortunately, been impossible to trace the writings of those mentioned in
the text. I should gratefully receive any information concerning the men or
their works. In dealing with famous authors like Lope de Vega or Góngora,
whose subsequent careers have fulfilled Cervantes's prophecies, it has been thought
unnecessary to give details which can be found in every history of Spanish
literature. It has occasionally happened that a writer is made the subject of a
longer note than his actual importance might seem, at first sight, to deserve.
The justification for this lies in the fact that such minor authors are more or less
intimately associated with Cervantes, or that the mention of their names affords
a convenient opportunity for discussing some point of interest in connexion
with his life or writings.</p>

<p>For the sake of convenience in referring from one author to another, the notes
to the <cite>Canto de Calíope</cite> have been numbered consecutively throughout.

dedicated to his memory. The phrase <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">el aprisco veneciano</i> is an allusion to
Diego Hurtado de Mendoza's embassy in Venice (1539-1547). It is not generally
known that Mendoza visited England as special Plenipotentiary in 1537-1538
with the object of arranging two marriages: one between Mary Tudor and Prince
Luiz of Portugal, and one between Henry VIII. and Charles V.'s handsome, witty
niece, Dorothea of Denmark (afterwards Duchess of Milan), who declined the
honour on the ground that she had only one head. Mendoza's mission was a
diplomatic failure: nor does he seem to have enjoyed his stay here. He was made
much of, was banqueted at Hampton Court, and confessed that life in England
was pleasant enough; but he sighed for Barcelona, and was glad to pass on to the
Low Countries and thence to Venice. See the <cite>Calendar of State Papers

<p><a id="Footnote_119" href="#FNanchor_119" class="label">[119]</a> Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga was born at Madrid in 1533. He was page to
Philip II at the latter's marriage with Mary Tudor in Winchester Cathedral. He
sailed for South America in 1555, served against the Araucanos under García
Hurtado de Mendoza, Marqués de Cañete, quarrelled with a brother officer named
Juan de Pineda, was sentenced to death, reprieved at the last moment, and is
said to have been exiled to Callao. Ercilla returned to Spain in 1562, bringing
with him the First Part of his epic poem, <cite>La Araucana</cite>, which he had composed
during his campaigns. The original draft was scribbled on stray pieces of paper
and scraps of leather: "que no me costó después poco trabajo juntarlos." This
First Part was published at Madrid in 1569: the Second Part appeared in 1578,
and the Third in 1590. The author died, a disappointed man, in 1594. For a
sound appreciation of his talent see <cite>L'Araucana, poème épique por D. Alonso
de Ercilla y Zúñiga. Morceaux choisis précedés d'une étude biographique

(Part I., chap. vi.) where he brackets it with Rufo's <cite>Austriada</cite> and Virués's
<cite>Monserrate</cite>:&mdash;"These three books," said the curate, "are the best that have

further stated to have revised the manuscript of Hurtado de Mendoza's <cite>Historia

de Toledo at Lisbon in 1627. He certainly wrote the introduction to Tribaldos

Philip II. The latter studied at the University of Louvain where his name was
wrongly Latinized as Gratianus (instead of Gracianus), and, on his return to
Spain, he adopted the form Gracián. He married a daughter of Johannes de
Curiis, called (from his birthplace) Dantiscus, successively Bishop of Culm (June,
1530) and of West Ermeland (January, 1538), and Polish ambassador at the
court of Charles V.: see Leo Czaplicki, <cite>De vita et carminibus Joannis de

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_152" href="#FNanchor_152" class="label">[152]</a> In the <cite>Dorotea</cite> (Act iv. sc. ii.) Lope de Vega speaks of "Bautista de Vivar,
monstruo de naturaleza en decir versos de improviso con admirable impulso de
las musas"; but Vivar's merits must be taken on trust, for his writings have not
been printed. A certain Vivar, author of some verses <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">á lo divino</i>, is mentioned
by Gallardo (<em>op. cit.</em>, vol. i., col. 1023), but no specimens are given from the
manuscript which was in existence as late as November 1, 1844.
</p>
<p>
The phrase&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">monstruo de naturaleza</i>&mdash;applied by Lope to Vivar was applied
by Cervantes to Lope in the preface to his <cite>Ocho Comedias y ocho entremeses
nuevos</cite> (Madrid, 1615). It occurs also in Lope's <cite>Hermosa Ester</cite>, the autograph
of which, dated April 5, 1610, is in the British Museum Library, Egerton MSS.
547. Mr. Henry Edward Watts (<cite>Miguel de Cervantes, his life &amp; works</cite>,
London, 1895, p. 109) contends that Cervantes uses the expression "in bad
part" (i.e. in a sense derogatory to Lope), and cites as a parallel case the
employment of it in <cite>Don Quixote</cite> (Part I. chap. xlvi) where Sancho Panza is
described as "monstruo de naturaleza, almario de embustes, silo de bellaquerías,
inventor de maldades, publicador de sandeces," and so forth. The words <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">monstruo
de naturaleza</i> are, no doubt, open to two interpretations. It is, however, inconceivable
that Cervantes would offer so gross an insult to his successful rival as
is thus imputed to him. In his bickerings with Lope, Cervantes may sometimes
forget himself, as will happen to the best of men at times; but such vulgarity as
this is absolutely unlike him. It may be as well to note that the expression&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">monstruo
de naturaleza</i>&mdash;was current as a compliment long before either
Cervantes or Lope used it; it will be found in Pedro de Cáceres y Espinosa's
preliminary <cite>Discurso</cite> to the poems of Gregorio Silvestre published in 1582.
</p>
<p>
Students of Spanish literary history will remember that Vivar's name was
introduced by one of the witnesses who appeared against Lope de Vega when the
latter was prosecuted for criminal libel at the beginning of 1588. Luis Vargas de
Manrique (mentioned in note 8) was reported by this witness as saying that, on
the internal evidence, one of the scandalous ballads which formed the basis of
the charge might be attributed to four or five different persons: "it may be by
Liñán (mentioned in note 25) who is not here, or by Cervantes, and he is not
here, and, since it is not mine, it may be by Vivar, or by Lope de Vega, though
Lope de Vega, if he had written it, would not so malign himself." See the <cite>Proceso
de Lope de Vega por libelo contra unos cómicos</cite> (Madrid, 1901) by the
Sres. Tomillo and Pérez Pastor.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_154" href="#FNanchor_154" class="label">[154]</a> Lope Félix de Vega Carpio was born at Madrid on November 25, 1562, and
died there on August 27, 1635. A soldier, a poet, a novelist, a dramatist, and a
priest, he ranks next to Cervantes in the history of Spanish literature. It is
impossible to give any notion of his powers within the compass of a note.
According to Pérez de Montalbán, Lope was the author of 1800 plays and 400
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">autos</i>: some 400 plays and some 50 <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">autos</i> survive, apart from innumerable
miscellaneous works. Lope's <cite>Obras completas</cite> are now being issued by the
Royal Spanish Academy under the editorship of Sr. D. Marcelino Menéndez y
Pelayo, and each succeeding volume&mdash;thirteen quarto volumes have already been
issued to subscribers&mdash;goes to justify his immense reputation. A short summary
of his dramatic achievement is given in my lecture on <cite>Lope de Vega and the
Spanish Drama</cite> (Glasgow and London, 1902); for fuller details of this amazing
genius and his work see Professor Hugo Albert Rennert's admirable biography
(Glasgow, 1903).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_156" href="#FNanchor_156" class="label">[156]</a> Fernando de Herrera, the chief of the Seville school of poets, was born in
1534 and died in 1597. Herrera, who was a cleric but not a priest, dedicated
many of his poems (1582) to the Condesa de Gelves, and there is interminable
discussion as to whether these verses are to be taken in a Platonic sense, or not.
Besides being a distinguished lyrical poet, Herrera proved himself an excellent
critic in the <cite>Anotaciones</cite> in his edition of Garcilaso de la Vega (1580). This
commentary was the occasion of a clever, scurrilous attack, circulated under the
pseudonym of Prete Jacopín, by Juan Fernández de Velasco, Conde de Haro, who
resented the audacity of an Andaluz in presuming to edit a Castilian poet. Haro
evidently thought that invective was an ornament of debate, for in <cite>Observación
XI.</cite> he calls his opponent <em>ydiotíssimo</em>, and in <cite>Observación XXVII.</cite>
he calls Herrera an ass: "sois Asno y no León."
</p>
<p>
Cervantes was a great admirer of Herrera whose death he commemorated in a
sonnet. Moreover, he wove into the short dedication of the First Part of <cite>Don
Quixote</cite> (to the Duque de Béjar) phrases borrowed from the dedication in
Herrera's edition of Garcilaso: see vol. iii. of the present edition (Glasgow,

<p><a id="Footnote_163" href="#FNanchor_163" class="label">[163]</a> Vicente Espinel was born in 1550 and is conjectured to have died between
1624 and 1634. He is said to have added a fifth string to the guitar, and to have
introduced <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">espinelas</i>: "perdónesele Dios," is Lope's comment in the <cite>Dorotea</cite>
(act. i. sc. vii.). Espinel's <cite>Diversas rimas</cite> (1591) are now only known to
students; but his picaresque novel, <cite>Marcos de Obregón</cite> (Madrid, 1618), still
finds, and deserves to find, many readers. In the 1775 edition of the <cite>Siècle
de Louis XIV.</cite> Voltaire alleged that <cite>Gil Blas</cite> was "entièrement pris du
roman espagnol <cite>La Vidad de lo Escudiero Dom Marcos d'Obrego</cite>." It will
be observed that, in transcribing the title, Voltaire makes almost as many
mistakes as the number of words allows. His statement is a grotesque
exaggeration, but it had the merit of suggesting a successful practical joke
to José Francisco de Isla. This sly wag translated <cite>Gil Blas</cite> into Spanish,
mischievously pretending that the book was thus "restored to its country and
native language by a jealous Spaniard who will not allow his nation to be made
fun of." Unluckily, the naughty Jesuit did not live to see the squabbles of the
learned critics who fell into the trap that he had baited for them. It is, by the
way, a curious and disputed point whether the Comte de Neufchâteau's celebrated
<cite>Examen de la question de savoir si Lesage est l'auteur de Gil Blas ou
s'il l'a pris de l'espagnol</cite> (1818) was, or was not, taken word for word from a
juvenile essay by Victor Hugo: see <cite>Victor Hugo raconté par un témoin de
sa vie</cite> (Bruxelles and Leipzig, 1863), vol. i., p. 396.
In the <cite>Adjunta al Parnaso</cite> Cervantes calls Espinel "uno de los más antiguos
y verdaderos amigos que yo tengo." In his <cite>Rimas</cite> Espinel had been most
complimentary to Cervantes. But Pellicer and Fernández de Navarrete have
spoken harshly of him for being (as they imagined) jealous of the success of <cite>Don
Quixote</cite>; and Mr. Henry Edward Watts (<em>op. cit.</em>, p. 157, <em>n.</em> 1) asserts that
Espinel "took occasion after Cervantes' death to speak of his own <cite>Marcos de
Obregón</cite> ... as superior to <cite>Don Quixote</cite>." This is not so. There may be
authors who suppose that their immortal masterpieces are superior to the
ephemeral writings of everybody else: but they seldom say this&mdash;at least, in
print. Nor did Espinel. It must suffice, for the moment, to note that the
above-mentioned fable is mainly based on the fact that the Gongoresque
poet and preacher, Hortensio Félix Paravicino y Arteaga, wrote as follows
in his <cite>Aprobación to Marcos de Obregón</cite>: "El Libro del Escudero, que
escriuio el Maestro Espinel, y V. M. me manda censurar, he visto, y no
hallo en el cosa que se oponga à nuestra santa Fè Catolica Romana, ni
ofenda à la piedad de las buenas costumbres della, antes de los libros deste
género, que parece de entretenimiento comun, es el que con más razón deue
ser impreso, por tener el prouecho tan cerca del deleyte, que sin perjudicar
enseña, y sin diuertir entretiene: el estilo, la inuencion, el gusto de las
cosas, y la moralidad, que deduze dellas, arguyen bien la pluma que la ha
escrito, tan justamente celebrada en todas naciones. A mi alomenos de los
libros deste argumento me parece la mejor cosa que nuestra lengua tendrà, y
que V.m. deue darle vna aprouacion muy honrada. Guarde nuestro Señor
à V. M."
</p>
<p>
It is Paravicino, not Espinel, who speaks: and the eulogistic phrases
which he uses do not exceed the limits of the recognized convention on
such occasions.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_164" href="#FNanchor_164" class="label">[164]</a> Jerónimo Sánchez de Carranza was introduced to England by Ben Jonson
as an authority on honour and arms. Bobadil, in <cite>Every Man in his humour</cite>
(Act 1, sc. 4) says:&mdash;"By the foot of Pharaoh, an' 'twere my case now I should
send him a chartel presently. The bastinado, a most proper and sufficient
dependence, warranted by the great Carranza." Carranza wrote the <cite>Philosophia
y destreza de las armas</cite> (Sanlúcar de Barrameda, 1582); a later treatise, the
<cite>Libro de las grandezas de la espada</cite> (Madrid, 1600) was issued by the
counter-expert of the next generation, Luis Pacheco de Narváez. I need scarcely
remind most readers that Pacheco de Narváez, the famous fencing-master, was
ignominiously disarmed by Quevedo&mdash;an incomparable hand with the foil,
despite his lameness and short sight. Pacheco naturally smarted under the
disgrace, and seems to have shown his resentment in an unpleasant fashion whenever
he had an opportunity. The respective merits of Carranza and Pacheco
divided Madrid into two camps. Literary men were prominent in the fray.
Suárez de Figueroa, Vélez de Guevara, and Ruiz de Alarcón declared for
Pacheco. Among Carranza's partisans were Luis Mendoza de Carmona
and, as might be expected, Quevedo who mentions the <cite>Libro de las grandezas

<p><a id="Footnote_168" href="#FNanchor_168" class="label">[168]</a> The correct, full form of this writer's name seems to be Juan de la Cueva de
Garoza. He is conjectured to have been born in 1550 and to have died in 1609.
This interesting dramatist was among the most distinguished of Lope de Vega's
immediate predecessors, and in such plays as <cite>El Cerco de Zamora</cite> he comes near
anticipating Lope's methods. In his <cite>Exemplar poético</cite> (1609) Cueva declares
that he was the first to bring kings upon the stage, an innovation that was censured
at the time:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Evidently Cueva did not know that Torres Naharro introduces a king in his
<cite>Aquilana</cite>. A reprint of Cueva's plays is urgently needed: his purely poetic
work is of slight value. An edition of <cite>El Viage de Sannio</cite>, with an
admirable Introduction by Professor Fredrik Amadeus Wulff will be found
in the <cite>Acta Universitatis Lundensis</cite> (Lund, 1887-1888), (Philosophi,

inordinately: see note 2. In truth the <cite>Austriada</cite> is a tedious performance,
being merely a poor rhythmical arrangement of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza's
<cite>Guerra de Granada</cite>. Mendoza's history was not published till 1627, long after
the author's death (1575). It was issued at Lisbon by Luis Tribaldos de Toledo
who, in the previous year, had brought out a posthumous edition of the poems of
Francisco de Figueroa&mdash;the Tirsi of the <cite>Galatea</cite>. Evidently, then, Rufo read

<p><a id="Footnote_176" href="#FNanchor_176" class="label">[176]</a> Luis Barahona de Soto was born in 1548 at Lucena (Lucena de Córdoba and
not Lucena del Puerto, as Barrera supposed). After some wanderings he settled
at Archidona where he practised medicine. He is said to have died <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab intestato</i>
on November 6, 1595. A complimentary sonnet by him appears in Cristóbal de
Mesa's <cite>Restauración de España</cite> (Madrid, 1607): it would seem, therefore,
that Mesa's <cite>Restauración</cite> must have been in preparation for at least a dozen
years. Some verses by Barahona de Soto are given in Espinosa's <cite>Flores de poetas
ilustres</cite>: four of his satires, and his <cite>Fábula de Acteón</cite> are printed in Juan José
López de Sedano's <cite>Parnaso Español</cite> (Madrid, 1768-1778), vol. ix., pp. 53-123.
Barahona de Soto's best known work is <cite>La primera parte de la Angélica</cite>
(Granada, 1586) which, in the colophon, has the alternative title of <cite>Las lágrimas
de Angélica</cite>. There is a famous allusion to this work in <cite>Don Quixote</cite> (Part I.,
chap. vi.):&mdash;"I should have shed tears myself," said the curate when he heard
the title, "had I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of the
famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy in the
translation of some of Ovid's fables." As Mr. Ormsby observed:&mdash;"The anti-climax

<p>See vol. iii. of the present edition (Glasgow, 1901), p. 53, <em>n.</em> 3.
It has often been questioned whether Barahona de Soto ever wrote a Second
Part of the <cite>Angélica</cite>. Since the publication of the <cite>Diálogos de la Montería</cite>
(Madrid, 1890) by the Sociedad de Bibliófilos Españoles, under the editorship of
Sr. D. Francisco R. de Uhagón, it seems practically certain that he at all events
began the Second Part, if he did not finish it. The <cite>Diálogos de la Montéria</cite>
contain numerous passages quoted from the Second Part; and in a biographical,
bibliographical and critical study, which Sr. D. Francisco Rodríguez Marín is now
correcting for the press, it will be shown that Barahona de Soto was, in all probability,
himself the author of these <cite>Diálogos</cite>.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_195" href="#FNanchor_195" class="label">[195]</a> The famous mystic writer and poet Luis Ponce de León was born at Belmonte
(Cuenca) in 1527, joined the Augustinian Order in 1544, and was appointed
professor of theology at Salamanca in 1561. He became involved in an academic
squabble and was absurdly suspected of conspiring with the professors of Hebrew,
Martín Martínez de Cantalapiedra and Juan Grajal, to interpret the Scriptures in a
rabbinical sense. A plot seems to have been organized against him by Bartolomé
de Medina, and, perhaps, by León de Castro, the professor of Greek at Salamanca.
Luis de León was likewise accused of having translated the <cite>Song of Songs</cite> in the
vernacular, and it has hitherto been thought that this charge told most heavily
against him in the eyes of the Holy Office. It now appears that the really damaging
accusation in the indictment referred to the supposed heterodoxy of Fray Luis's
views as to the authority of the Vulgate: see a learned series of chapters entitled
<cite>Fray Luis de León; estudio biográfico y crítico</cite> published by the Rev. Father
Francisco Blanco García (himself an Augustinian monk) in <cite>La Ciudad de Dios</cite>
(from January 20, 1897 onwards, at somewhat irregular intervals). Luis de León
was arrested in March 1572 and imprisoned till December 1576, when he was
discharged as innocent. In 1579 he was appointed to the chair of Biblical
History at Salamanca, his chief competitor being Fray Domingo de Guzmán,
son of the great poet Garcilaso de la Vega. In 1582 Fray Luis was once more
prosecuted before the Inquisition because of his supposed heterodoxy concerning
the question <cite>de auxiliis</cite>: see the <cite>Segundo proceso instruído por la Inquisición
de Valladolid contra Fray Luis de León</cite> (Madrid, 1896), annotated by the
Rev. Father Francisco Blanco García. In 1591 Fray Luis was elected Provincial
of the Augustinian Order: he died ten days later. While in jail he
wrote what is, perhaps, the noblest mystic work in the Spanish language, <cite>Los
Nombres de Cristo</cite>, the first two books of which were published in 1583&mdash;the
complete work (including a third book) being issued in 1585. In 1583 also
appeared his <cite>Perfecta casada</cite>. Fray Luis, in a fortunate hour for mankind,
edited the writings of Santa Teresa, rescuing from the rash tamperings of
blunderers works which he instantly recognized as masterpieces. His verses were
published by Quevedo in 1631: they at once gave Fray Luis rank as one of the
great Spanish poets, though he himself seems to have looked upon them as mere
trifles.</p></div>

see note 86. His <cite>Isabela</cite>, <cite>Fílis</cite> and <cite>Alejandra</cite> are praised in <cite>Don Quixote</cite> as
"three tragedies acted in Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms,
which were such that they filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, and
interest, the ignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as the higher orders,
and brought in more money to the performers, these three alone, than thirty of

López de Sedano in <cite>El Parnaso Español</cite> (Madrid, 1768-1778), vol. vi., pp.
312-524. There may be a touch of friendly exaggeration in Cervantes's account
of their success on the boards. At all events, the author of these pieces soon
abandoned the stage, and, when the theatres were closed on the death of the
Queen of Piedmont, he was prominent among those who petitioned that the closure
might be made permanent. A Royal decree in that sense was issued on May 2,
1598. In the following year Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola was appointed chief
chronicler of Aragón. The <cite>Isabela</cite> and <cite>Alejandra</cite> are reprinted in the first

<p><a id="Footnote_203" href="#FNanchor_203" class="label">[203]</a> Bartolomé Leonardo de Argensola was born in 1562 and died in 1631. He

chronicler of Aragón. He published the <cite>Conquista de las Islas Malacas</cite>
(Madrid, 1609), and the <cite>Anales de Aragón</cite> (Zaragoza, 1631)&mdash;the latter being
a continuation of Jerónimo de Zurita's <cite>Anales de la Corona de Aragón</cite>
(1562-1580). The poems of both brothers were issued by Lupercio's son, Gabriel
Leonardo de Albión, in a volume entitled <cite>Las Rimas que se han podido recoger</cite>
<cite>de Lupercio, y del Doctor Bartolomé Leonardo de Argensola</cite> (Zaragoza,
1634). Lope de Vega had a great esteem for the Argensolas whose polished
diction, rare in men of Aragonese birth, he regarded as an antidote to the extravagances&mdash;the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">frases horribles</i>, as he says&mdash;of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">culteranismo</i>. The very considerable
merits of the Argensolas were likewise appreciated by Cervantes who,
however, seems to have cooled somewhat towards the brothers when the Conde de
Lemos, on his appointment as Viceroy of Naples, attached them to his household.
It is said that Cervantes himself hoped to form part of Lemos's suite, and that he
was annoyed with the Argensolas for not pushing his claims as vigorously as he
expected of them. At this distance of time, it is impossible for us to know what
really happened; but a passage in the <cite>Viaje del Parnaso</cite> (cap. iii.) does appear
to imply that Cervantes had a grievance of some kind against the Argensolas:&mdash;</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_210" href="#FNanchor_210" class="label">[210]</a> Andrés Rey de Artieda was born in 1549 and died in 1613. His youth was
one of rare promise. Though not yet fourteen years old when Gil Polo wrote
the <cite>Diana enamorada</cite>, he is introduced to us as a poet in the <cite>Canto del
Turia</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container2 pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p>y prometernos han sus tiernas flores<br />
frutos entre los buenos los mejores.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>This phrase may have been in Cervantes's mind when writing of his own play,
<cite>La Confusa</cite>: "la cual, con paz sea dicho de cuantas comedias de capa y espada
hasta hoy se han representado, bien puede tener lugar señalado par buena entre
las mejores" (see the <cite>Adjunta al Parnaso</cite>).
</p>
<p>
Artieda graduated in arts at the University of Valencia in 1563, and studied later
at Lérida and Tolosa, taking his degree as doctor of both civil and canonical law at
the age of twenty. This brilliant academic success was received <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">con aplauso y
pronósticos extraños</i>, and a great future seemed to await him. However, he
was something of a rolling stone. He practised for a short while at the bar, but
abandoned the profession in disgust and entered the army. Here, again, he
seemed likely to carry all before him. In his first campaign he was promoted at
a bound to the rank of captain, but his luck was now run out. Like Cervantes,
he received three wounds at Lepanto. He was present at the relief of Cyprus,
and served under Parma in the Low Countries. His intrepidity was proverbial,
and he is said to have swum across the Ems in midwinter, his sword gripped
between his teeth, under the enemy's fire. These heroic feats do not appear to
have brought him advancement, and, in the <cite>Viaje del Parnaso</cite> (cap. iii.),
Cervantes, who would seem to have known him personally, speaks of Artieda
grown old as&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p1">Más rico de valor que de moneda.</p>

<p>
Artieda is said to have written plays entitled <cite>El Príncipe vicioso</cite>, <cite>Amadís de
Gaula</cite>, and <cite>Los Encantos de Merlín</cite>: he is the author of a mediocre tragedy,
<cite>Los Amantes</cite> (Valencia, 1581) which may have been read by Tirso de Molina
before he wrote <cite>Los Amantes de Teruel</cite>. Artieda published an anthology of
his verses under the pseudonym of Artemidoro: <cite>Discursos, epístolas y epigramas
de Artemidoro</cite> (Zaragoza, 1605). Some passages in this collection express
the writer's hostility to the new drama, and betray a certain pique at the success
of his former friend, Lope de Vega. Lope, however, praises Artieda very
generously in the <cite>Laurel de Apolo</cite> (silva ii.).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_211" href="#FNanchor_211" class="label">[211]</a> Gaspar Gil Polo published the <cite>Diana enamorada</cite> at Valencia in 1564. The
Priest in <cite>Don Quixote</cite> decided that it should "be preserved as if it came from
Apollo himself": see vol. iii. of the present edition (Glasgow, 1901), p. 51. It is
unquestionably a work of unusual merit in its kind, but some deduction must be
made from Cervantes's hyperbolical praise: he evidently succumbed to the temptation
of playing on the words Polo and Apollo.
</p>
<p>
Gaspar Gil Polo is said by Ticknor to have been professor of Greek at Valencia.
There was a Gil Polo who held the Greek chair in the University of that city
between 1566 and 1574: but his name was not Gaspar. Nicolás Antonio and
others maintain that the author of the <cite>Diana enamorada</cite> was the celebrated
lawyer, Gaspar Gil Polo, who appeared to plead before the Cortes in 1626. This
Gaspar Gil Polo was a mere boy when the <cite>Diana enamorada</cite> was issued sixty-two
years earlier. He was probably the son of the author: see Justo Pastor
Fuster, <cite>Biblioteca Valenciana de las escritores que florecieron hasta nuestros
días</cite> (Valencia, 1827-1830), vol. i., pp. 150-155, and&mdash;more especially&mdash;Professor
Hugo Albert Rennert, <cite>The Spanish Pastoral Romances</cite> (Baltimore, 1892), p. 31.
</p>
<p>
As already stated in note 91, Gil Polo contributed a sonnet to Girón y de
Rebolledo's <cite>Pasión</cite>, which appeared a year before the <cite>Diana enamorada</cite>.
Another of his sonnets is found in Sempere's <cite>Carolea</cite> (1560). In the <cite>Serao de
Amor</cite>, Timoneda speaks of him as a celebrated poet; but, as we see from the
<cite>Canto de Calíope</cite> itself, these flourishes and compliments often mean next to
nothing. It is somewhat strange that Gil Polo, who is said to have died at
Barcelona in 1591, did not issue a sequel to his <cite>Diana enamorada</cite> during the
twenty-seven years of life which remained to him after the publication of the
First Part in 1564. At the end of the <cite>Diana enamorada</cite> he promised a Second
Part as clearly as Cervantes, after him, promised a Second Part of the <cite>Galatea</cite>:
"Las quales (fiestas) ... y otras cosas de gusto y de provecho están tratadas en
la otra parte deste libro, que antes de muchos días, placiendo á Dios, será
impresa." Gil Polo is believed to have been absorbed by his official duties as
Maestre Racional of the Royal Court in the Kingdom of Valencia. His <cite>Canto
del Turia</cite>, inserted in the third book of the <cite>Diana enamorada</cite>, is one of the
models&mdash;perhaps the chief model&mdash;of the present <cite>Canto de Calíope</cite>. Cervantes
follows Gil Polo very closely.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_212" href="#FNanchor_212" class="label">[212]</a> The dramatist, Cristóbal de Virués, was born in 1550 and died in 1610. Like
Cervantes and Artieda, he fought at Lepanto. His <cite>Obras trágicas y líricas</cite>

<p><a id="Footnote_217" href="#FNanchor_217" class="label">[217]</a> Pedro de Láinez joined with Cervantes in writing eulogistic verses for
Padilla's <cite>Jardín espiritual</cite>: see note 27. Examples of his skill are given in
Pedro Espinosa's <cite>Flores de poetas ilustres de España</cite> (1605). Fernández de
Navarrete, in his biography of Cervantes, states (p. 116) that Láinez died in 1605:
he is warmly praised by Lope de Vega in the <cite>Laurel de Apolo</cite> (silva iv.).
</p>
<p>
His widow, Juana Gaitán, lived at Valladolid in the same house as Cervantes
and his family: she is mentioned, not greatly to her credit, in the depositions
of some of the witnesses examined with reference to the death of Gaspar
de Ezpeleta; but too much importance may easily be given to this tittle-tattle.
Luisa de Montoya, a very respectable widow, corroborated the evidence of other
witnesses who assert that the neighbours gossiped concerning the visits paid
to Láinez's widow by the Duque de Pastrana and the Conde de Concentaina&mdash;"que
venian a tratar de un libro que había compuesto un fulano Laynez, su
primer marido."</p>

<p>The contemptuous phrase&mdash;<cite>un fulano Laynez</cite>&mdash;would imply that Luisa de
Montoya was not a person of literary tastes: she was, however, widow of the
chronicler, Esteban de Garibay Zamalloa, author of the <cite>Ilustraciones genealogicas
de los catholicos reyes de las Españas, y de los christianissimos de Francia,
y de los Emperadores de Constantinopla, hasta el Catholico Rey nuestro
Señor Don Philipe el II y sus serenissimos hijos</cite> (Madrid, 1596). The words&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">su
primer marido</i>&mdash;which are likewise used by another witness (Cervantes's
niece, Costanza de Ovando), might be taken, if construed literally, to mean that
Láinez's widow had married again shortly after her husband's death: for the
evidence was taken on June 29, 1605. But, apparently, the inference would be
wrong. When examined in jail, to which she was committed with Cervantes and
others, Juana Gaitán described herself as over thirty-five years of age, and as the
widow of the late Pedro Láinez. She accounted for Pastrana's visits, which had
given rise to scandal, by saying that she intended to dedicate to him two books
by her late husband, and that Pastrana had merely called to thank her in due
form. A reference to Pastrana in the <cite>Viaje del Parnaso</cite> (cap. viii.) seems to
suggest that Pastrana was a munificent patron:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container2 pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Desde allí, y no sé cómo, fuí traído</span><br />
Adonde ví al gran Duque de Pastrana<br />
Mil parabienes dar de bien venido;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Y que la fama en la verdad ufana</span><br />
Contaba que agradó con su presencia,<br />
Y con su cortesía sobrehumana:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Que fué nuevo Alejandro en la excelencia</span><br />
Del dar, que satisfizo á todo cuanto<br />
Puede mostrar real magnificencia.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>It is a little unlucky that these works by Láinez, concerning the publication of
which the author's zealous widow consulted Pastrana, should not after all have
found their way into print. For details of the evidence in the Ezpeleta case,
see Dr. Pérez Pastor's <cite>Documentos Cervantinos hasta ahora inéditos</cite> (Madrid,
1902), vol. ii., pp. 455-527.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_218" href="#FNanchor_218" class="label">[218]</a> Francisco de Figueroa, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">el Divino</i>, was born at Alcalá de Henares in 1536
and is conjectured to have died as late as 1620. Very little is known of this
distinguished poet. He is said to have served as a soldier in Italy where his
verses won him so high a reputation that he was compared to Petrarch. He
married Doña María de Vargas on February 14, 1575, at Alcalá de Henares, and
travelled with the Duque de Terranova through the Low Countries in 1597.
After this date he disappears. He is stated to have died at Lisbon, and to have
directed that all his poems should be burned. Such of them as were saved were
published at Lisbon in 1626 by Luis Tribaldos de Toledo. As noted in the <cite>Introduction</cite>
(p. xxxi. <em>n.</em> 2) to the present version, Figueroa is the Tirsi of the <cite>Galatea</cite>.
There is a strong family likeness between the poems of Figueroa and those of the
Bachiller Francisco de la Torre, whose verses were issued by Quevedo in 1631.
So marked is this resemblance that, as M. Ernest Mérimée has written:&mdash;"Un
critique, que le paradoxe n'effraierait point, pourrait, sans trop de peine, soutenir
l'identité de Francisco de la Torre et de Francisco de Figueroa." See his
admirable <cite>Essai sur la vie et les œuvres de Francisco de Quevedo</cite> (Paris, 1886),

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
